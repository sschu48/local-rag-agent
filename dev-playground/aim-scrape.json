                "section-content": "A clearance issued by ATC is predicated on known traffic and known physical airport conditions. An ATC clearance means an authorization by ATC, for the purpose of preventing collision between known aircraft, for an aircraft to proceed under specified conditions within controlled airspace. IT IS NOT AUTHORIZATION FOR A PILOT TO DEVIATE FROM ANY RULE, REGULATION, OR MINIMUM ALTITUDE NOR TO CONDUCT UNSAFE OPERATION OF THE AIRCRAFT.\n\n\n14 CFR Section 91.3(a) states: \u201cThe pilot-in-command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to, the operation of that aircraft.\u201d If ATC issues a clearance that would cause a pilot to deviate from a rule or regulation, or in the pilot's opinion, would place the aircraft in jeopardy, IT IS THE PILOT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST AN AMENDED CLEARANCE. Similarly, if a pilot prefers to follow a different course of action, such as make a 360 degree turn for spacing to follow traffic when established in a landing or approach sequence, land on a different runway, takeoff from a different intersection, takeoff from the threshold instead of an intersection, or delay operation, THE PILOT IS EXPECTED TO INFORM ATC ACCORDINGLY. When the pilot requests a different course of action, however, the pilot is expected to cooperate so as to preclude disruption of traffic flow or creation of conflicting patterns. The pilot is also expected to use the\u2009appropriate aircraft call sign to acknowledge all ATC clearances, frequency changes, or advisory information.\n\nEach pilot who deviates from an ATC clearance in response to a Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System resolution advisory must notify ATC of that deviation as soon as possible.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nP/CG Term - TRAFFIC ALERT AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM.\n\n\nWhen weather conditions permit, during the time an IFR flight is operating, it is the direct responsibility of the pilot to avoid other aircraft since VFR flights may be operating in the same area without the knowledge of ATC. Traffic clearances provide standard separation only between IFR flights."

                "section-content": "Clearance Limit. The traffic clearance issued prior to departure will normally authorize flight to the airport of intended landing. Many airports and associated NAVAIDs are collocated with the same name and/or identifier, so care should be exercised to ensure a clear understanding of the clearance limit. When the clearance limit is the airport of intended landing, the clearance should contain the airport name followed by the word \u201cairport.\u201d Under certain conditions, a clearance limit may be a NAVAID or other fix. When the clearance limit is a NAVAID, intersection, or waypoint and the type is known, the clearance should contain type. Under certain conditions, at some locations a short-range clearance procedure is utilized whereby a clearance is issued to a fix within or just outside of the terminal area and pilots are advised of the frequency on which they will receive the long-range clearance direct from the center controller.\n\n\nDeparture Procedure. Headings to fly and altitude restrictions may be issued to separate a departure from other air traffic in the terminal area. Where the volume of traffic warrants, DPs have been developed.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-2-6, Abbreviated IFR Departure Clearance (Cleared. . .as Filed) Procedures.\nAIM, Para 5-2-9, Instrument Departure Procedures (DP) - Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP) and Standard Instrument Departures (SID).\n\n\nRoute of Flight.\n\nClearances are normally issued for the altitude or flight level and route filed by the pilot. However, due to traffic conditions, it is frequently necessary for ATC to specify an altitude or flight level or route different from that requested by the pilot. In addition, flow patterns have been established in certain congested areas or between congested areas whereby traffic capacity is increased by routing all traffic on preferred routes. Information on these flow patterns is available in offices where preflight briefing is furnished or where flight plans are accepted.\n\n\nWhen required, air traffic clearances include data to assist pilots in identifying radio reporting points. It is the responsibility of pilots to notify ATC immediately if their radio equipment cannot receive the type of signals they must utilize to comply with their clearance.\n\nAltitude Data.\n\nThe altitude or flight level instructions in an ATC clearance normally require that a pilot \u201cMAINTAIN\u201d the altitude or flight level at which the flight will operate when in controlled airspace. Altitude or flight level changes while en route should be requested prior to the time the change is desired.\n\n\nWhen possible, if the altitude assigned is different from the altitude requested by the pilot, ATC will inform the pilot when to expect climb or descent clearance or to request altitude change from another facility. If this has not been received prior to crossing the boundary of the ATC facility's area and assignment at a different altitude is still desired, the pilot should reinitiate the request with the next facility.\n\nThe term \u201ccruise\u201d may be used instead of \u201cMAINTAIN\u201d to assign a block of airspace to a pilot from the minimum IFR altitude up to and including the altitude specified in the cruise clearance. The pilot may level off at any intermediate altitude within this block of airspace. Climb/descent within the block is to be made at the discretion of the pilot. However, once the pilot starts descent and verbally reports leaving an altitude in the block, the pilot may not return to that altitude without additional ATC clearance.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nP/CG Term - CRUISE.\n\n\nHolding Instructions.\n\nWhenever an aircraft has been cleared to a fix other than the destination airport and delay is expected, it is the responsibility of the ATC controller to issue complete holding instructions (unless the pattern is charted), an EFC time, and a best estimate of any additional en route/terminal delay.\n\n\nIf the holding pattern is charted and the controller doesn't issue complete holding instructions, the pilot is expected to hold as depicted on the appropriate chart. When the pattern is charted, the controller may omit all holding instructions except the charted holding direction and the statement AS\u2009PUBLISHED, e.g., \u201cHOLD EAST AS PUBLISHED.\u201d Controllers must always issue complete holding instructions when pilots request them.\n\nNOTE-\nOnly those holding patterns depicted on U.S. government or commercially produced charts which meet FAA requirements should be used.\n\nIf no holding pattern is charted and holding instructions have not been issued, the pilot should ask ATC for holding instructions prior to reaching the fix. This procedure will eliminate the possibility of an aircraft entering a holding pattern other than that desired by ATC. If unable to obtain holding instructions prior to reaching the fix (due to frequency congestion, stuck microphone, etc.), hold in a standard pattern on the course on which you approached the fix and request further clearance as soon as possible. In this event, the altitude/flight level of the aircraft at the clearance limit will be protected so that separation will be provided as required.\n\nWhen an aircraft is 3 minutes or less from a clearance limit and a clearance beyond the fix has not been received, the pilot is expected to start a speed reduction so that the aircraft will cross the fix, initially, at or below the maximum holding airspeed.\n\nWhen no delay is expected, the controller should issue a clearance beyond the fix as soon as possible and, whenever possible, at least 5 minutes before the aircraft reaches the clearance limit.\n\nPilots should report to ATC the time and altitude/flight level at which the aircraft reaches the clearance limit and report leaving the clearance limit.\n\nNOTE-\nIn the event of two-way communications failure, pilots are required to comply with 14 CFR Section 91.185."

Pilots may obtain an explanation by directing a letter or telephone call to the chief controller of the facility involved.\n\nPilots have the privilege of requesting a different clearance from that which has been issued by ATC if they feel that they have information which would make another course of action more practicable or if aircraft equipment limitations or company procedures forbid compliance with the clearance issued."

When ATC issues a clearance or instruction, pilots are expected to execute its provisions upon receipt. ATC, in certain situations, will include the word \u201cIMMEDIATELY\u201d in a clearance or instruction to impress urgency of an imminent situation and expeditious compliance by the pilot is expected and necessary for safety. The addition of a VFR or other restriction; i.e., climb or descent point or time, crossing altitude, etc., does not authorize a pilot to deviate from the route of flight or any other provision of the ATC clearance.\n\n\nWhen a heading is assigned or a turn is requested by ATC, pilots are expected to promptly initiate the turn, to complete the turn, and maintain the new heading unless issued additional instructions.\n\nThe term \u201cAT PILOT'S DISCRETION\u201d included in the altitude information of an ATC clearance means that ATC has offered the pilot the option to start climb or descent when the pilot wishes, is authorized to conduct the climb or descent at any rate, and to temporarily level off at any intermediate altitude as desired. However, once the aircraft has vacated an altitude, it may not return to that altitude.\n\nWhen ATC has not used the term \u201cAT PILOT'S DISCRETION\u201d nor imposed any climb or descent restrictions, pilots should initiate climb or descent promptly on acknowledgement of the clearance. Descend or climb at an optimum rate consistent with the operating characteristics of the aircraft to 1,000\u2009feet above or below the assigned altitude, and then attempt to descend or climb at a rate of between 500 and 1,500 fpm until the assigned altitude is reached. If at anytime the pilot is unable to climb or descend at a rate of at least 500 feet a minute, advise ATC. If it is necessary to level off at an intermediate altitude during climb or descent, advise ATC, except when leveling off at 10,000 feet MSL on descent, or 2,500 feet above airport elevation (prior to entering a Class C or Class D surface area), when required for speed reduction.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\n14 CFR Section 91.117.\n\n\nNOTE-\nLeveling off at 10,000 feet MSL on descent or 2,500 feet above airport elevation (prior to entering a Class\u2009C or Class D surface area) to comply with 14 CFR Section\u200991.117 airspeed restrictions is commonplace. Controllers anticipate this action and plan accordingly. Leveling off at any other time on climb or descent may seriously affect air traffic handling by ATC. Consequently, it is imperative that pilots make every effort to fulfill the above expected actions to aid ATC in safely handling and expediting traffic.\n\nIf the altitude information of an ATC DESCENT clearance includes a provision to \u201cCROSS (fix) AT\u201d or \u201cAT OR ABOVE/BELOW (altitude),\u201d the manner in which the descent is executed to comply with the crossing altitude is at the pilot's discretion. This authorization to descend at pilot's discretion is only applicable to that portion of the flight to which the crossing altitude restriction applies, and the pilot is expected to comply with the crossing altitude as a provision of the clearance. Any other clearance in which pilot execution is optional will so state \u201cAT PILOT'S DISCRETION.\u201d\n\n\nEXAMPLE-\u201cUnited Four Seventeen, descend and maintain six\u2009thousand.\u201d\n\nNOTE-The pilot is expected to commence descent upon receipt of the clearance and to descend at the suggested rates until reaching the assigned altitude of 6,000 feet.\nEXAMPLE-\u201cUnited Four Seventeen, descend at pilot's discretion, maintain six thousand.\u201d\nNOTE-The pilot is authorized to conduct descent within the context of the term at pilot's discretion as described above.\nEXAMPLE-\u201cUnited Four Seventeen, cross Lakeview V-O-R at or above Flight Level two zero zero, descend and maintain six\u2009thousand.\u201d\nNOTE-The pilot is authorized to conduct descent at pilot's discretion until reaching Lakeview VOR and must comply with the clearance provision to cross the Lakeview VOR at or above FL 200. After passing Lakeview VOR, the pilot is expected to descend at the suggested rates until reaching the assigned altitude of 6,000 feet.\nEXAMPLE-\u201cUnited Four Seventeen, cross Lakeview V-O-R at six\u2009thousand, maintain six thousand.\u201d\nNOTE-The pilot is authorized to conduct descent at pilot's discretion, however, must comply with the clearance provision to cross the Lakeview VOR at 6,000 feet.\nEXAMPLE-\u201cUnited Four Seventeen, descend now to Flight Level\u2009two seven zero, cross Lakeview V-O-R at or below one zero thousand, descend and maintain six thousand.\u201d\nNOTE-The pilot is expected to promptly execute and complete descent to FL 270 upon receipt of the clearance. After reaching FL 270 the pilot is authorized to descend \u201cat pilot's discretion\u201d until reaching Lakeview VOR. The pilot must comply with the clearance provision to cross Lakeview VOR at or below 10,000 feet. After Lakeview VOR the pilot is expected to descend at the suggested rates until reaching 6,000 feet.\nEXAMPLE-\u201cUnited Three Ten, descend now and maintain Flight Level two four zero, pilot's discretion after reaching Flight Level two eight zero.\u201d\nNOTE-The pilot is expected to commence descent upon receipt of the clearance and to descend at the suggested rates until reaching FL 280. At that point, the pilot is authorized to continue descent to FL 240 within the context of the term \u201cat pilot's discretion\u201d as described above.\nIn case emergency authority is used to deviate from provisions of an ATC clearance, the pilot-in-command must notify ATC as soon as possible and obtain an amended clearance. In an emergency situation which does not result in a deviation from the rules prescribed in 14 CFR Part 91 but which requires ATC to give priority to an aircraft, the pilot of such aircraft must, when requested by ATC, make a report within 48 hours of such emergency situation to the manager of that ATC facility.\n\nThe guiding principle is that the last ATC clearance has precedence over the previous ATC clearance. When the route or altitude in a previously issued clearance is amended, the controller will restate applicable altitude restrictions. If altitude to maintain is changed or restated, whether prior to departure or while airborne, and previously issued altitude restrictions are omitted, those altitude restrictions are canceled, including departure procedures and STAR altitude restrictions.\n\nEXAMPLE-A departure flight receives a clearance to destination airport to maintain FL 290. The clearance incorporates a DP which has certain altitude crossing restrictions. Shortly after takeoff, the flight receives a new clearance changing the maintaining FL from 290 to 250. If the altitude restrictions are still applicable, the controller restates them.A departing aircraft is cleared to cross Fluky Intersection at or above 3,000 feet, Gordonville VOR at or above 12,000 feet, maintain FL 200. Shortly after departure, the altitude to be maintained is changed to FL\u2009240. If the altitude restrictions are still applicable, the controller issues an amended clearance as follows:\u201ccross Fluky Intersection at or above three thousand, cross Gordonville V-O-R at or above one two thousand, maintain Flight Level two four zero.\u201dAn arriving aircraft is cleared to the destination airport via V45 Delta VOR direct; the aircraft is cleared to cross Delta VOR at 10,000 feet, and then to maintain 6,000 feet. Prior to Delta VOR, the controller issues an amended clearance as follows:\u201cturn right heading one eight zero for vector to runway three six I-L-S approach, maintain six\u2009thousand.\u201d\nNOTE-\nBecause the altitude restriction \u201ccross Delta V-O-R at 10,000 feet\u201d was omitted from the amended clearance, it is no longer in effect.\n\nPilots of turbojet aircraft equipped with afterburner engines should advise ATC prior to takeoff if they intend to use afterburning during their climb to the en route altitude. Often, the controller may be able to plan traffic to accommodate a high performance climb and allow the aircraft to climb to the planned altitude without restriction.\n\nIf an \u201cexpedite\u201d climb or descent clearance is issued by ATC, and the altitude to maintain is subsequently changed or restated without an expedite instruction, the expedite instruction is canceled. Expedite climb/descent normally indicates to the pilot that the approximate best rate of climb/descent should be used without requiring an exceptional change in aircraft handling characteristics. Normally controllers will inform pilots of the reason for an instruction to expedite."

However, when the aircraft reaches the end of the STAR, the last published speed on the STAR must be maintained until ATC deletes it, assigns a new speed, issues a vector, assigns a direct route, or issues an approach clearance.\n\n\nATC will express all speed adjustments in terms\u2009of knots based on indicated airspeed (IAS) in 5\u2009or 10 knot increments except that at or above FL 240 speeds may be expressed in terms of Mach numbers in 0.01\u2009increments. The use of Mach numbers is restricted to turbojet aircraft with Mach meters.\n\nPilots complying with speed adjustments (published or assigned) are expected to maintain a speed within plus or minus 10\u2009knots or 0.02 Mach number of the specified speed.\n\nWhen ATC assigns speed adjustments, it will be\u2009in accordance with the following recommended minimums:\n\nTo aircraft operating between FL 280 and 10,000 feet, a speed not less than 250 knots or the equivalent Mach number.\n\nNOTE-\nOn a standard day the Mach numbers equivalent to 250\u2009knots CAS (subject to minor variations) are:\nFL 240-0.6\nFL 250-0.61\nFL 260-0.62\nFL 270-0.64\nFL 280-0.65\nFL 290-0.66.When an operational advantage will be realized, speeds lower than the recommended minima may be applied.\n\n\nTo arriving turbojet aircraft operating below 10,000 feet:\n\nA speed not less than 210 knots, except;\n\n\nWithin 20 flying miles of the airport of intended landing, a speed not less than 170 knots.\n\nTo arriving reciprocating engine or turboprop aircraft within 20 flying miles of the runway threshold of the airport of intended landing, a speed not less than 150 knots.\n\nTo departing aircraft:\n\nTurbojet aircraft, a speed not less than 230\u2009knots.\n\n\nReciprocating engine aircraft, a speed not less than 150 knots.\n\nWhen ATC combines a speed adjustment with a descent clearance, the sequence of delivery, with the word \u201cthen\u201d between, indicates the expected order of execution.\n\nEXAMPLE-Descend and maintain (altitude); then, reduce speed to (speed).Reduce speed to (speed); then, descend and maintain (altitude).\nNOTE-\nThe maximum speeds below 10,000 feet as established in 14 CFR Section 91.117 still apply. If there is any doubt concerning the manner in which such a clearance is to be executed, request clarification from ATC.\n\nIf ATC determines (before an approach clearance is issued) that it is no longer necessary to apply speed adjustment procedures, they will:\n\nAdvise the pilot to \u201cresume normal speed.\u201d Normal speed is used to terminate ATC assigned speed adjustments on segments where no published speed restrictions apply. It does not cancel published restrictions on upcoming procedures. This does not relieve the pilot of those speed restrictions which are applicable to 14\u00a0CFR Section\u00a091.117.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n(An aircraft is flying a SID with no published speed restrictions. ATC issues a speed adjustment and instructs the aircraft where the adjustment ends): \u201cMaintain two two zero knots until BALTR then resume normal speed.\u201d\nNOTE-\nThe ATC assigned speed assignment of two two zero knots would apply until BALTR. The aircraft would then resume a normal operating speed while remaining in compliance with 14 CFR Section 91.117.\n\n\nInstruct pilots to \u201ccomply with speed restrictions\u201d when the aircraft is joining or resuming a charted procedure or route with published speed restrictions.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n(ATC vectors an aircraft off of a SID to rejoin the procedure at a subsequent waypoint. When instructing the aircraft to resume the procedure, ATC also wants the aircraft to comply with the published procedure speed restrictions): \u201cResume the SALTY ONE departure. Comply with speed restrictions.\u201d\nCAUTION-\nThe phraseology \u201cDescend via/Climb via SID\u201d requires compliance with all altitude and/or speed restrictions depicted on the procedure.\n\nInstruct the pilot to \u201cresume published speed.\u201d Resume published speed is issued to terminate a speed adjustment where speed restrictions are published on a charted procedure.\n\nNOTE-\nWhen instructed to \u201ccomply with speed restrictions\u201d or to \u201cresume published speed,\u201d ATC anticipates pilots will begin adjusting speed the minimum distance necessary prior to a published speed restriction so as to cross the waypoint/fix at the published speed. Once at the published speed, ATC expects pilots will maintain the published speed until additional adjustment is required to comply with further published or ATC assigned speed restrictions or as required to ensure compliance with 14 CFR Section\u200991.117.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n(An aircraft is flying a SID/STAR with published speed restrictions. ATC issues a speed adjustment and instructs the aircraft where the adjustment ends): \u201cMaintain two two zero knots until BALTR then resume published speed.\u201d\nNOTE-\nThe ATC assigned speed assignment of two two zero knots would apply until BALTR. The aircraft would then comply with the published speed restrictions.\n\nAdvise the pilot to \u201cdelete speed restrictions\u201d when either ATC assigned or published speed restrictions on a charted procedure are no longer required.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n(An aircraft is flying a SID with published speed restrictions designed to prevent aircraft overtake on departure. ATC determines there is no conflicting traffic and deletes the speed restriction): \u201cDelete speed restrictions.\u201d\nNOTE-\nWhen deleting published restrictions, ATC must ensure obstacle clearance until aircraft are established on a route where no published restrictions apply. This does not relieve the pilot of those speed restrictions which are applicable to 14 CFR Section 91.117.\n\nInstruct the pilot to \u201cclimb via\u201d or \u201cdescend via.\u201d A climb via or descend via clearance cancels any previously issued speed restrictions and, once established on the depicted departure or arrival, to climb or descend, and to meet all published or assigned altitude and/or speed restrictions.\n\nEXAMPLE-(An aircraft is flying a SID with published speed restrictions. ATC has issued a speed restriction of 250 knots for spacing. ATC determines that spacing between aircraft is adequate and desires the aircraft to comply with published restrictions): \u201cUnited 436, Climb via SID.\u201d(An aircraft is established on a STAR. ATC must slow an aircraft for the purposes of spacing and assigns it a speed of 280 knots. When spacing is adequate, ATC deletes the speed restriction and desires that the aircraft comply with all published restrictions on the STAR): \u201cGulfstream two three papa echo, descend via the TYLER One arrival.\u201d\nNOTE-\nIn example 1, when ATC issues a \u201cClimb via SID\u201d clearance, it deletes any previously issued speed and/or altitude restrictions. The pilot should then vertically navigate to comply with all speed and/or altitude restrictions published on the SID.In example 2, when ATC issues a \u201cDescend via  arrival,\u201d ATC has canceled any previously issued speed and/or altitude restrictions. The pilot should vertically navigate to comply with all speed and/or altitude restrictions published on the STAR.\n\nCAUTION-\nWhen descending on a STAR, pilots should not speed up excessively beyond the previously issued speed. Otherwise, adequate spacing between aircraft descending on the STAR that was established by ATC with the previous restriction may be lost.\n\nApproach clearances supersede any prior speed adjustment assignments, and pilots are expected to make their own speed adjustments as necessary to complete the approach. However, under certain circumstances, it may be necessary for ATC to issue further speed adjustments after approach clearance is issued to maintain separation between successive arrivals. Under such circumstances, previously issued speed adjustments will be restated if that speed is to be maintained or additional speed adjustments are requested. Speed adjustments should not be assigned inside the final approach fix on final or a point 5 miles from the runway, whichever is closer to the runway.\n\nThe pilots retain the prerogative of rejecting the application of speed adjustment by ATC if the minimum safe airspeed for any particular operation is greater than the speed adjustment.\n\nNOTE-\nIn such cases, pilots are expected to advise ATC of the speed that will be used.\n\nPilots are reminded that they are responsible for rejecting the application of speed adjustment by ATC if, in their opinion, it will cause them to exceed the maximum indicated airspeed prescribed by 14 CFR Section\u200991.117(a), (c) and (d). IN SUCH CASES, THE PILOT IS EXPECTED TO SO INFORM ATC. Pilots operating at or above 10,000 feet MSL who are issued speed adjustments which exceed 250 knots IAS and are subsequently cleared below 10,000 feet MSL are expected to comply with 14 CFR Section\u200991.117(a).\n\nSpeed restrictions of 250 knots do not apply to U.S. registered aircraft operating beyond 12 nautical miles from the coastline within the U.S. Flight Information Region, in Class E airspace below 10,000 feet MSL. However, in airspace underlying a Class B airspace area designated for an airport, or in a VFR corridor designated through such as a Class B airspace area, pilots are expected to comply with the 200 knot speed limit specified in 14 CFR Section\u200991.117(c).\n\nFor operations in a Class C and Class\u2009D surface area, ATC is authorized to request or approve a speed greater than the maximum indicated airspeeds prescribed for operation within that airspace (14 CFR Section 91.117(b)).\n\nNOTE-\nPilots are expected to comply with the maximum speed of 200 knots when operating beneath Class B airspace or in a Class B VFR corridor (14 CFR Section 91.117(c) and\u2009(d)).\n\nWhen in communications with the ARTCC or approach control facility, pilots should, as a good operating practice, state any ATC assigned speed restriction on initial radio contact associated with an ATC communications frequency change."

                "section-content": "Visual separation is a means employed by ATC to separate aircraft in terminal areas and en route airspace in the NAS. There are two methods employed to effect this separation:\n\nThe tower controller sees the aircraft involved and issues instructions, as necessary, to ensure that the aircraft avoid each other.\n\n\nA pilot sees the other aircraft involved and upon instructions from the controller provides separation by maneuvering the aircraft to avoid it. When pilots accept responsibility to maintain visual separation, they must maintain constant visual surveillance and not pass the other aircraft until it is no longer a factor.\n\nNOTE-\nTraffic is no longer a factor when during approach phase the other aircraft is in the landing phase of flight or executes a missed approach; and during departure or en\u2009route, when the other aircraft turns away or is on a diverging course.\n\n\nA pilot's acceptance of instructions to follow another aircraft or provide visual separation from it is an acknowledgment that the pilot will maneuver the aircraft as necessary to avoid the other aircraft or to maintain in-trail separation. In operations conducted behind heavy aircraft, or a small aircraft behind a B757 or other large aircraft, it is also an acknowledgment that the pilot accepts the responsibility for wake turbulence separation. Visual separation is prohibited behind super aircraft.\n\nNOTE-\nWhen a pilot has been told to follow another aircraft or to provide visual separation from it, the pilot should promptly notify the controller if visual contact with the other aircraft is lost or cannot be maintained or if the pilot cannot accept the responsibility for the separation for any reason.\n\nScanning the sky for other aircraft is a key factor in collision avoidance. Pilots and copilots (or the right seat passenger) should continuously scan to cover all areas of the sky visible from the cockpit. Pilots must develop an effective scanning technique which maximizes one's visual capabilities. Spotting a potential collision threat increases directly as more time is spent looking outside the aircraft. One must use timesharing techniques to effectively scan the surrounding airspace while monitoring instruments as well.\n\nSince the eye can focus only on a narrow viewing area, effective scanning is accomplished with a series of short, regularly spaced eye movements that bring successive areas of the sky into the central visual field. Each movement should not exceed ten degrees, and each area should be observed for at least one second to enable collision detection. Although many pilots seem to prefer the method of horizontal back-and-forth scanning every pilot should develop a scanning pattern that is not only comfortable but assures optimum effectiveness. Pilots should remember, however, that they have a regulatory responsibility (14 CFR Section\u200991.113(a)) to see and avoid other aircraft when weather conditions permit."

Prior to taxiing onto a runway or landing area in preparation for takeoff, pilots should scan the approach areas for possible landing traffic and execute the appropriate clearing maneuvers to provide them a clear view of the approach areas.\n\n\nClimbs and Descents. During climbs and descents in flight conditions which permit visual detection of other traffic, pilots should execute gentle banks, left and right at a frequency which permits continuous visual scanning of the airspace about them.\n\nStraight and Level. Sustained periods of straight and level flight in conditions which permit visual detection of other traffic should be broken at intervals with appropriate clearing procedures to provide effective visual scanning.\n\nTraffic Pattern. Entries into traffic patterns while descending create specific collision hazards and should be avoided.\n\nTraffic at VOR Sites. All operators should emphasize the need for sustained vigilance in the vicinity of VORs and airway intersections due to the convergence of traffic.\n\nTraining Operations. Operators of pilot training programs are urged to adopt the following practices:\n\nPilots undergoing flight instruction at all levels should be requested to verbalize clearing procedures (call out \u201cclear\u201d left, right, above, or below) to instill and sustain the habit of vigilance during maneuvering.\n\n\nHigh-wing airplane. Momentarily raise the wing in the direction of the intended turn and look.\n\nLow-wing airplane. Momentarily lower the wing in the direction of the intended turn and look.\n\nAppropriate clearing procedures should precede the execution of all turns including chandelles, lazy eights, stalls, slow flight, climbs, straight and level, spins, and other combination maneuvers.\n\nScanning Techniques for Traffic Avoidance.\n\nPilots must be aware of the limitations inherent in the visual scanning process. These limitations may include:\n\nReduced scan frequency due to concentration on flight instruments or tablets and distraction with passengers.\n\n\nBlind spots related to high-wing and low-wing aircraft in addition to windshield posts and sun visors.\n\nPrevailing weather conditions including reduced visibility and the position of the sun.\n\nThe attitude of the aircraft will create additional blind spots.\n\nThe physical limitations of the human eye, including the time required to (re)focus on near and far objects, from the instruments to the horizon for example; empty field myopia, narrow field of vision and atmospheric lighting all affect our ability to detect another aircraft.\n\n\nBest practices to see and avoid:\n\nADS-B In is an effective system to help pilots see and avoid other aircraft. If your aircraft is equipped with ADS-B In, it is important to understand its features and how to use it properly. Many units provide visual and/or audio alerts to supplement the system's traffic display. Pilots should incorporate the traffic display in their normal traffic scan to provide awareness of nearby aircraft. Prior to entering or crossing any runway, ADS-B In can provide advance indication of arriving aircraft and aircraft in the traffic pattern. Systems that incorporate a traffic-alerting feature can help minimize the pilot's inclination to fixate on the display. Refer to 4-5-7e, ADS-B Limitations.\n\n\nUnderstand the limitations of ADS-B In. In certain airspace, not all aircraft will be equipped with ADS-B Out or transponders and will not be visible on your ADS-B In display.\n\nLimit the amount of time that you focus on flight instruments or tablets.\n\nDevelop a strategic approach to scanning for traffic. Scan the entire sky and try not to focus straight ahead."

IFR operations in any class of controlled airspace requires that a pilot must file an IFR flight plan and receive an appropriate ATC clearance.\n\nIFR Separation. Standard IFR separation is provided to all aircraft operating under IFR in controlled airspace.\n\nVFR Requirements. It is the responsibility of the pilot to ensure that ATC clearance or radio communication requirements are met prior to entry into Class B, Class C, or Class D airspace.

A clearance for a visual approach to a primary airport is not authorization for turbine- powered airplanes to operate below the designated floors of the Class B airspace.\n\n\nVFR Flights.\n\nArriving aircraft must obtain an ATC clearance prior to entering Class B airspace and must contact ATC on the appropriate frequency, and in relation to geographical fixes shown on local charts. Although a pilot may be operating beneath the floor of the Class B airspace on initial contact, communications with ATC should be established in relation to the points indicated for spacing and sequencing purposes.\n\n\nDeparting aircraft require a clearance to depart Class B airspace and should advise the clearance delivery position of their intended altitude and route of flight. ATC will normally advise VFR aircraft when leaving the geographical limits of the Class B airspace. Radar service is not automatically terminated with this advisory unless specifically stated by the controller.\n\nAircraft not landing or departing the primary airport may obtain an ATC clearance to transit the Class\u2009B airspace when traffic conditions permit and provided the requirements of 14 CFR Section 91.131 are met. Such VFR aircraft are encouraged, to the extent possible, to operate at altitudes above or below the Class B airspace or transit through established VFR corridors. Pilots operating in VFR corridors are urged to use frequency 122.750 MHz for the exchange of aircraft position information.\n\nATC Clearances and Separation. An ATC clearance is required to enter and operate within Class\u2009B airspace. VFR pilots are provided sequencing and separation from other aircraft while operating within Class B airspace.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 4-1-18, Terminal Radar Services for VFR Aircraft.\n\n\nNOTE-\nSeparation and sequencing of VFR aircraft will be suspended in the event of a radar outage as this service is dependent on radar. The pilot will be advised that the service is not available and issued wind, runway information and the time or place to contact the tower.\n\nVFR aircraft are separated from all VFR/IFR aircraft which weigh 19,000 pounds or less by a minimum of:\n\nTarget resolution, or\n\n\n500 feet vertical separation, or\n\nVisual separation.\n\n\nVFR aircraft are separated from all VFR/IFR aircraft which weigh more than 19,000 and turbojets by no less than:\n\n1 1/2 miles lateral separation, or\n\n\n500 feet vertical separation, or\n\nVisual separation.\n\nThis program is not to be interpreted as relieving pilots of their responsibilities to see and avoid other traffic operating in basic VFR weather conditions, to adjust their operations and flight path as necessary to preclude serious wake encounters, to maintain appropriate terrain and obstruction clearance or to remain in weather conditions equal to or better than the minimums required by 14 CFR Section 91.155. Approach control should be advised and a revised clearance or instruction obtained when compliance with an assigned route, heading and/or altitude is likely to compromise pilot responsibility with respect to terrain and obstruction clearance, vortex exposure, and weather minimums.\n\nATC may assign altitudes to VFR aircraft that do not conform to 14 CFR Section 91.159. \u201cRESUME APPROPRIATE VFR ALTITUDES\u201d will be broadcast when the altitude assignment is no longer needed for separation or when leaving Class B airspace. Pilots must return to an altitude that conforms to 14 CFR Section 91.159.\n\nProximity Operations. VFR aircraft operating in proximity to Class B airspace are cautioned against operating too closely to the boundaries, especially where the floor of the Class B airspace is 3,000 feet or less above the surface or where VFR cruise altitudes are at or near the floor of higher levels. Observance of this precaution will reduce the potential for encountering an aircraft operating at the altitudes of Class B floors. Additionally, VFR aircraft are encouraged to utilize the VFR Planning Chart as a tool for planning flight in proximity to Class B airspace. Charted VFR Flyway Planning Charts are published on the back of the existing VFR Terminal Area Charts."

                "section-content": "Definition. Generally, that airspace from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and that have a certain number of IFR operations or passenger enplanements. Although the configuration of each Class C airspace area is individually tailored, the airspace usually consists of a 5 NM radius core surface area that extends from the surface up to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation, and a 10 NM radius shelf area that extends no lower than 1,200\u2009feet up to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation.\n\n\nCharts. Class C airspace is charted on Sectional Charts, IFR En Route Low Altitude, and Terminal Area Charts where appropriate.\n\nOperating Rules and Pilot/Equipment Requirements:\n\nPilot Certification. No specific certification required.\n\n\nEquipment.\n\nTwo\u2010way radio; and\n\n\nUnless otherwise authorized by ATC, an operable radar beacon transponder with automatic altitude reporting capability and operable ADS-B Out equipment.\n\nNOTE-\nSee paragraph 4-1-20, Transponder and ADS-B Out Operation, subparagraph f for Mode C transponder/ ADS-B requirements for operating above Class C airspace.\n\nArrival or Through Flight Entry Requirements. Two\u2010way radio communication must be established with the ATC facility providing ATC services prior to entry and thereafter maintain those communications while in Class C airspace. Pilots of arriving aircraft should contact the Class C airspace ATC facility on the publicized frequency and give their position, altitude, radar beacon code, destination, and request Class C service. Radio contact should be initiated far enough from the Class C airspace boundary to preclude entering Class C airspace before two\u2010way radio communications are established.\n\nNOTE-\nIf the controller responds to a radio call with, \u201c(aircraft callsign) standby,\u201d radio communications have been established and the pilot can enter the Class C airspace.If workload or traffic conditions prevent immediate provision of Class C services, the controller will inform the pilot to remain outside the Class C airspace until conditions permit the services to be provided.It is important to understand that if the controller responds to the initial radio call without using the aircraft identification, radio communications have not been established and the pilot may not enter the Class C airspace.Class C airspace areas have a procedural Outer Area. Normally this area is 20 NM from the primary Class C airspace airport. Its vertical limit extends from the lower limits of radio/radar coverage up to the ceiling of the approach control's delegated airspace, excluding the Class C airspace itself, and other airspace as appropriate. (This outer area is not charted.)Pilots approaching an airport with Class C service should be aware that if they descend below the base altitude of the 5 to 10 mile shelf during an instrument or visual approach, they may encounter non-transponder/non-ADS-B VFR aircraft.\n\nEXAMPLE-[Aircraft callsign] \u201cremain outside the Class Charlie airspace and standby.\u201d\u201cAircraft calling Dulles approach control, standby.\u201d\nDepartures from:\n\nA primary or satellite airport with an operating control tower. Two\u2010way radio communications must be established and maintained with the control tower, and thereafter as instructed by ATC while operating in Class C airspace.\n\n\nA satellite airport without an operating control tower. Two\u2010way radio communications must be established as soon as practicable after departing with the ATC facility having jurisdiction over the Class C airspace.\n\nAircraft Speed. Unless otherwise authorized or required by ATC, no person may operate an aircraft at or below 2,500 feet above the surface within 4 nautical miles of the primary airport of a Class C airspace area at an indicated airspeed of more than 200 knots (230 mph).\n\nAir Traffic Services. When two\u2010way radio communications and radar contact are established, all VFR aircraft are:\n\nSequenced to the primary airport.\n\n\nProvided Class C services within the Class C airspace and the outer area.\n\nProvided basic radar services beyond the outer area on a workload permitting basis. This can be terminated by the controller if workload dictates.\n\nAircraft Separation. Separation is provided within the Class C airspace and the outer area after two\u2010way radio communications and radar contact are established. VFR aircraft are separated from IFR aircraft within the Class C airspace by any of the following:\n\nVisual separation.\n\n\n500 feet vertical separation.\n\nTarget resolution.\n\nWake turbulence separation will be provided to all aircraft operating:\n\nBehind and less than 1,000 feet below super or heavy aircraft,\n\n\nTo small aircraft operating behind and less than 500 feet below B757 aircraft, and\n\nTo small aircraft following a large aircraft on final approach.\n\nNOTE-\nSeparation and sequencing of VFR aircraft will be suspended in the event of a radar outage as this service is dependent on radar. The pilot will be advised that the service is not available and issued wind, runway information and the time or place to contact the tower.Pilot participation is voluntary within the outer area and can be discontinued, within the outer area, at the pilot's request. Class C services will be provided in the outer area unless the pilot requests termination of the service.Some facilities provide Class C services only during published hours. At other times, terminal IFR radar service will be provided. It is important to note that the communications and transponder/ADS-B requirements are dependent on the class of airspace established outside of the published hours.\n\nSecondary Airports\n\nIn some locations Class C airspace may overlie the Class D surface area of a secondary airport. In order to allow that control tower to provide service to aircraft, portions of the overlapping Class\u2009C airspace may be procedurally excluded when the secondary airport tower is in operation. Aircraft operating in these procedurally excluded areas will only be provided airport traffic control services when in communication with the secondary airport tower.\n\n\nAircraft proceeding inbound to a satellite airport will be terminated at a sufficient distance to allow time to change to the appropriate tower or advisory frequency. Class C services to these aircraft will be discontinued when the aircraft is instructed to contact the tower or change to advisory frequency.\n\nAircraft departing secondary controlled airports will not receive Class C services until they have been radar identified and two\u2010way communications have been established with the Class C airspace facility.\n\nThis program is not to be interpreted as relieving pilots of their responsibilities to see and avoid other traffic operating in basic VFR weather conditions, to adjust their operations and flight path as necessary to preclude serious wake encounters, to maintain appropriate terrain and obstruction clearance or to remain in weather conditions equal to or better than the minimums required by 14 CFR Section 91.155. Approach control should be advised and a revised clearance or instruction obtained when compliance with an assigned route, heading and/or altitude is likely to compromise pilot responsibility with respect to terrain and obstruction clearance, vortex exposure, and weather minimums.\n\nClass C Airspace Areas by State. These states currently have designated Class C airspace areas that are depicted on sectional charts. Pilots should consult current sectional charts and NOTAMs for the latest information on services available. Pilots should be aware that some Class C airspace underlies or is adjacent to Class\u2009B airspace.

Generally, Class D airspace extends upward from the surface to 2,500 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL) surrounding those airports that have an operational control tower. The configuration of each Class D airspace area is individually tailored and when instrument procedures are published, the airspace will normally be designed to contain the procedures.\n\nClass D surface areas may be designated as full-time (24 hour tower operations) or part-time. Part-time Class D effective times are published in the Chart Supplement.\n\n\nWhere a Class D surface area is part-time, the airspace may revert to either a Class E surface area (see paragraph 3-2-6e1) or Class G airspace. When a part-time Class D surface area changes to Class G, the surface area becomes Class G airspace up to, but not including, the overlying controlled airspace.\n\nNOTE-\nThe airport listing in the Chart Supplement will state the part-time surface area status (for example, \u201cother times CLASS E\u201d or \u201cother times CLASS G\u201d).Normally, the overlying controlled airspace is the Class E transition area airspace that begins at either 700 feet AGL (charted as magenta vignette) or 1200 feet AGL (charted as blue vignette). This may be determined by consulting the applicable VFR Sectional or Terminal Area Charts.\n\n\nOperating Rules and Pilot/Equipment Requirements:\n\nPilot Certification. No specific certification required.\n\n\nEquipment. Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, an operable two-way radio is required.\n\nArrival or Through Flight Entry Requirements. Two-way radio communication must be established with the ATC facility providing ATC services prior to entry and thereafter maintain those communications while in the Class D airspace. Pilots of arriving aircraft should contact the control tower on the publicized frequency and give their position, altitude, destination, and any request(s). Radio contact should be initiated far enough from the Class\u2009D airspace boundary to preclude entering the Class D airspace before two-way radio communications are established.\n\nNOTE-\nIf the controller responds to a radio call with, \u201c[aircraft callsign] standby,\u201d radio communications have been established and the pilot can enter the Class D airspace.If workload or traffic conditions prevent immediate entry into Class D airspace, the controller will inform the pilot to remain outside the Class D airspace until conditions permit entry.\n\nEXAMPLE-\u201c[Aircraft callsign] remain outside the Class Delta airspace and standby.\u201d\nIt is important to understand that if the controller responds to the initial radio call without using the aircraft callsign, radio communications have not been established and the pilot may not enter the Class D airspace.\u201cAircraft calling Manassas tower standby.\u201d\nAt those airports where the control tower does not operate 24 hours a day, the operating hours of the tower will be listed on the appropriate charts and in the Chart Supplement. During the hours the tower is not in operation, the Class E surface area rules or a combination of Class E rules to 700 feet above ground level and Class G rules to the surface will become applicable. Check the Chart Supplement for specifics.\nDepartures from:\n\nA primary or satellite airport with an operating control tower. Two\u2010way radio communications must be established and maintained with the control tower, and thereafter as instructed by ATC while operating in the Class D airspace.\n\n\nA satellite airport without an operating control tower. Two\u2010way radio communications must be established as soon as practicable after departing with the ATC facility having jurisdiction over the Class D airspace as soon as practicable after departing.\n\nAircraft Speed. Unless otherwise authorized or required by ATC, no person may operate an aircraft at or below 2,500 feet above the surface within 4 nautical miles of the primary airport of a Class D airspace area at an indicated airspeed of more than 200 knots (230 mph).\n\nClass D airspace areas are depicted on Sectional and Terminal charts with blue segmented lines, and on IFR En Route Lows with a boxed [D].\n\nSurface area arrival extensions:\n\nClass D surface area arrival extensions for instrument approach procedures may be Class D or Class E airspace. As a general rule, if all extensions are 2 miles or less, they remain part of the Class D surface area. However, if any one extension is greater than 2 miles, then all extensions will be Class E airspace.\n\n\nSurface area arrival extensions are effective during the published times of the surface area. For part-time Class D surface areas that revert to Class E airspace, the arrival extensions will remain in effect as Class E airspace. For part-time Class D surface areas that change to Class G airspace, the arrival extensions will become Class G at the same time.\n\nSeparation for VFR Aircraft. No separation services are provided to VFR aircraft."

Unless otherwise authorized by ATC:\n\nAn operable radar beacon transponder with automatic altitude reporting capability and operable ADS-B Out equipment are required at and above 10,000 feet MSL within the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia, excluding the airspace at and below 2,500 feet above the surface, and\n\n\nOperable ADS-B Out equipment at and above 3,000 feet MSL over the Gulf of Mexico from the coastline of the United States out to 12 nautical miles.\n\nNOTE-\nThe airspace described in (b) is specified in 14 CFR \u00a7 91.225 for ADS-B Out requirements. However, 14 CFR \u00a7 91.215 does not include this airspace for transponder requirements.\n\nArrival or Through Flight Entry Requirements. No specific requirements.\n\nCharts. Class E airspace below 14,500 feet MSL is charted on Sectional, Terminal, and IFR Enroute Low Altitude charts.\n\nVertical limits. Except where designated at a lower altitude (see paragraph 3-2-6e, below, for specifics), Class E airspace in the United States consists of:\n\nThe airspace extending upward from 14,500 feet MSL to, but not including, 18,000 feet MSL overlying the 48\u2009contiguous states, the District of Columbia and Alaska, including the waters within nautical 12 miles from the coast of the 48 contiguous states and Alaska; excluding:\n\nThe Alaska peninsula west of longitude\u2009160\u00b000'00''W.; and\n\n\n The airspace below 1,500\u2009feet above the surface of the earth unless specifically designated lower (for example, in mountainous terrain higher than 13,000 feet MSL).\n\n\nThe airspace above FL 600 is Class E airspace.\n\nFunctions of Class E Airspace. Class E airspace may be designated for the following purposes:\n\nSurface area designated for an airport where a control tower is not in operation. Class E surface areas extend upward from the surface to a designated altitude, or to the adjacent or overlying controlled airspace.  The airspace will be configured to contain all instrument procedures.\n\nTo qualify for a Class E surface area, the airport must have weather observation and reporting capability, and communications capability must exist with aircraft down to the runway surface.\n\n\nA Class E surface area may also be designated to accommodate part-time operations at a Class C or Class D airspace location (for example, those periods when the control tower is not in operation).\n\nPilots should refer to the airport page in the applicable Chart Supplement for surface area status information.\n\n\nExtension to a surface area. Class\u2009E airspace may be designated as extensions to Class B, Class\u2009C, Class D, and Class E surface areas. Class E airspace extensions begin at the surface and extend up to the overlying controlled airspace. The extensions provide controlled airspace to contain standard instrument approach procedures without imposing a communications requirement on pilots operating under VFR. Surface area arrival extensions become part of the surface area and are in effect during the same times as the surface area.\n\nNOTE-\nWhen a Class C or Class D surface area is not in effect continuously (for example, where a control tower only operates part-time), the surface area airspace will change to either a Class E surface area or Class G airspace. In such cases, the \u201cAirspace\u201d entry for the airport in the Chart Supplement will state \u201cother times Class E\u201d or \u201cother times Class G.\u201d When a part-time surface area changes to Class E airspace, the Class E arrival extensions will remain in effect as Class E airspace. If a part-time Class C, Class D, or Class E surface area becomes Class G airspace, the arrival extensions will change to Class G at the same time.\n\nAirspace used for transition. Class E airspace areas may be designated for transitioning aircraft to/from the terminal or en route environment.\n\nClass\u2009E transition areas extend upward from either 700 feet AGL (shown as magenta vignette on sectional charts) or 1,200 feet AGL (blue vignette) and are designated for airports with an approved instrument procedure.\n\n\nThe 700-foot/1200-foot AGL Class E airspace transition areas remain in effect continuously, regardless of airport operating hours or surface area status.\n\nNOTE-\nDo not confuse the 700-foot and 1200-foot Class E transition areas with surface areas or surface area extensions.\n\nEn Route Domestic Areas. There are Class\u2009E airspace areas that extend upward from a specified altitude and are en route domestic airspace areas that provide controlled airspace in those areas where there is a requirement to provide IFR en route ATC services but the Federal airway system is inadequate.\n\nFederal Airways and Low-Altitude RNAV Routes. Federal airways and low-altitude RNAV routes are Class E airspace areas and, unless otherwise specified, extend upward from 1,200 feet AGL to, but not including,18,000 feet MSL.\n\nFederal airways consist of Low/Medium Frequency (L/MF) airways (colored Federal airways) and VOR Federal airways.\n\nL/MF airways are based on non-directional beacons (NDB) and are identified as green, red, amber, or blue.\n\n\nVOR Federal airways are based on VOR/VORTAC facilities and are identified by a \u201cV\u201d prefix.\n\n\nLow-altitude RNAV routes consist of T-routes and helicopter RNAV routes (TK-routes).\n\nNOTE-\nSee AIM paragraph 5-3-4, Airways and Route Systems, for more details and charting information.\n\nOffshore Airspace Areas. There are Class\u2009E airspace areas that extend upward from a specified altitude to, but not including, 18,000 feet MSL and are designated as offshore airspace areas. These areas provide controlled airspace beyond 12\u2009miles from the coast of the U.S. in those areas where there is a requirement to provide IFR en route ATC services and within which the U.S. is applying domestic procedures.\n\nSeparation for VFR Aircraft. No separation services are provided to VFR aircraft."

Pilot responsibilities are in the CFRs and the air traffic controllers' are in the FAA Order JO 7110.65, Air\u2009Traffic Control, and supplemental FAA directives. Additional and supplemental information for pilots can be found in the current Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), Notices to Air Missions, Advisory Circulars and aeronautical charts. Since there are many other excellent publications produced by nongovernment organizations, as well as other government organizations, with various updating cycles, questions concerning the latest or most current material can be resolved by cross\u2010checking with the above mentioned documents.\n\n\nThe pilot-in-command of an aircraft is directly responsible for, and is the final authority as to the safe operation of that aircraft. In an emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot-in-command may deviate from any rule in the General Subpart A and Flight Rules Subpart B in accordance with 14 CFR Section 91.3.\n\nThe air traffic controller is responsible to give first priority to the separation of aircraft and to the issuance of radar safety alerts, second priority to other services that are required, but do not involve separation of aircraft and third priority to additional services to the extent possible.\n\nIn order to maintain a safe and efficient air traffic system, it is necessary that each party fulfill their responsibilities to the fullest.\n\nThe responsibilities of the pilot and the controller intentionally overlap in many areas providing a degree of redundancy. Should one or the other fail in any manner, this overlapping responsibility is expected to compensate, in many cases, for failures that may affect safety.\n\nThe following, while not intended to be all inclusive, is a brief listing of pilot and controller responsibilities for some commonly used procedures or phases of flight. More detailed explanations are contained in other portions of this publication, the appropriate CFRs, ACs and similar publications. The information provided is an overview of the principles involved and is not meant as an interpretation of the rules nor is it intended to extend or diminish responsibilities."

Automatic scaling and alerting changes are appropriate for some operations. For example, TSO-C129 systems change within 30 miles of destination and within 2 miles of FAF to support approach operations. For some navigation systems and operations, manual selection of scaling will be necessary.Pilots flying FMS equipped aircraft with barometric vertical navigation (Baro-VNAV) may descend when the aircraft is established on-course following FMS leg transition to the next segment. Leg transition normally occurs at the turn bisector for a fly-by waypoint (reference paragraph 1-2-1 for more on waypoints). When using full automation, pilots should monitor the aircraft to ensure the aircraft is turning at appropriate lead times and descending once established on-course.Pilots flying TSO-C129 navigation system equipped aircraft without full automation should use normal lead points to begin the turn. Pilots may descend when established on-course on the next segment of the approach."

                "section-content": "Large public UAS may have wingspans as large as commercial airliners, and may operate in and out of public/military dual-use airfields. Due to the high altitudes at which these UAS routinely operate, and the means through which they reach and vacate operating altitudes, encounters with manned or low-altitude unmanned traffic are rare.\n\n\nPublic users operating as \u201cpublic aircraft\u201d retain the responsibility to determine airworthiness and pilot qualifications. Aircraft certification and operating rules apply to the entire UAS, including the aircraft itself, the flight crew with their associated qualifications, the control station, and command and control links.\n\nNOTE-\nLarge UAS operating in controlled airspace generally communicate on radio frequencies or through an ATC-to-PIC ground communications link assigned to that sector, terminal area, or control tower. The UAS PIC is required to comply with all ATC instructions and uses standard phraseology per FAA Order JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, and this manual.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\n49 USC 40102, Definitions.\n49 USC 40125, Qualifications for Public Aircraft Status.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control.\nAIM, Para 11-4-3, Airspace Access for Public Aircraft Operations PAO.\n\n\nOperating characteristics of large public UAS. To illustrate the sizes and performance of large public UAS, consider the DoD UAS classification system. The categories (see FIG 11-3-1) are separated based on MGOW, normal operating altitude, and flying speed. These classifications do not apply to non-DoD civil aircraft. Generally, Groups 1 through 3 UAS will operate on and above military bases, in restricted or prohibited airspace. For this reason, these smaller tactical public aircraft will rarely be encountered by civil pilots. Groups 4 and 5 are the largest of DoD UAS, weighing over 1,320 pounds, and operating at all speeds and altitudes. Group 4 aircraft operate at all altitudes, usually below 18,000 feet MSL. Group 5 aircraft typically operate well above 18,000 feet MSL. UAS in Groups 4 and 5 require airfields with specially approved surfaces to safely operate. For specifications and descriptions of the aircraft models that the DoD operates, refer to military service fact sheets.\n\nNOTE-\nThe category chart does not specify the actual high gross weights at which some DoD UAS actually operate. For instance, the RQ-4 Global Hawk regularly operates at approximately 32,000 pounds.)JP 3-30, III 31, Joint Publication 3-30, provides the UAS Categorization Chart and may be reviewed at:https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/jp3_30.pdf?ver=2019-09-04-142255-657.These websites provide unclassified descriptions, performance, and specifications of the varied UAS in the DoD's large category fleet:USAF Fact Sheets at https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/ and USN Fact Files at https://www.navy.mil/Resources/Fact-Files/.\nFIG 11-3-1DoD UAS Categories\n\nLarge Public UAS Engineering Characteristics and Operating Areas:\n\nLarge public UAS may be sharing airspace with civil aircraft in the NAS. A wide variety of aircraft performance, voice radio communications, command and control link architecture, and operating procedures exists throughout the DoD and other large public UAS enterprises. For example, Group 4 DoD aircraft, such as the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper, are typically propeller-driven with propulsion units that are internal combustion piston- or turbine-powered. The largest public UAS include single-engine jet aircraft such as the RQ-4 Global Hawk and MQ-4C Triton.\n\n\nVLOS and BVLOS link systems provide command and control for these large UAS operations. Voice communication capability in the largest public UAS is far more extensive than in the smaller aircraft. Many models are limited to a single voice radio transmitter and receiver system for control inside airspace managed by and/or delegated to the DoD.\n\nMany of the larger public UAS are equipped with transponders to assist ATC with position and tracking information. These UAS usually operate under IFR under positive ATC control and will tend to be found at very high altitudes; not likely to be encountered by civil aircraft operators. Launch and recovery operations will be likewise under positive ATC control and these UAS will be separated from any other known aircraft traffic. Encounters with low-altitude small UAS, being flown in uncontrolled airspace or under low-altitude controlled airspace authorizations, are therefore unlikely. In accordance with 14 CFR Section 91.215(e)(2), ATC Transponder and Altitude Reporting Equipment and Use, no person may operate an unmanned aircraft under Part 91 with a transponder on unless: (1) the operation is conducted under a flight plan and the person operating the unmanned aircraft maintains two-way communications with ATC; or (2) the use of a transponder is otherwise authorized by the Administrator.\n\nNOTE-\nIn accordance with 14 CFR Section 107.52, ATC Transponder Equipment Prohibition, unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, no person may operate a sUAS under Part 107 with a transponder on.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\n14 CFR Section 91.215, ATC Transponder and Altitude Reporting Equipment and Use.\n14 CFR Section 107.52, ATC Transponder Equipment Prohibition.\n\n\nLarge Public UAS Launch, Recovery, and Operating Areas:\n\nLarge public UAS operations are widespread, they are also carefully managed to ensure enhanced safety for other NAS users. For this reason, DoD UAS operate in many types of special use airspace. See FIG 11-3-2 for examples of Special Use Airspace (SUA) used by DoD UAS.\nFIG 11-3-2DoD Special Use Airspace\n\n\nTemporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) are issued for the surrounding UAS operating locations and allow for the launch and recovery of larger UAS. Once outside of the terminal environment, DoD UAS utilize the full range of SUA, including Military Operating Areas (MOA), restricted areas, warning areas, and alert areas to conduct their missions."

Large UAS is not an FAA- recognized category of aircraft.\n\nLarge UAS must meet performance, equipage requirements, and adhere to relevant procedures commensurate with the airspace in which the UAS is operating.\n\n\nAbsent an onboard pilot, large UAS are unable to \u201csee and avoid\u201d other aircraft, as required by regulations governing the general operation of aircraft in the NAS under Title 14 CFR Section 91.111, Operating Near other Aircraft, and 14 CFR Section 91.113, Right of Way Rules: Except Water Operations. As a result, they cannot use visual observation to remain \u201cwell clear\u201d of other aircraft and avoid collisions. Therefore, an alternate means of compliance is required to remain well clear of other aircraft and surface obstacles, and avoid collisions.\n\nFIG 11-3-3, A Layered Approach for Collision Avoidance, illustrates the different layers used to keep aircraft safely separated, beginning with airspace classification and design, then ending with the responsibility of the pilot to prevent collisions.\nFIG 11-3-3A Layered Approach for Collision Avoidance\n\n\nTransition to full integration into the NAS. Over time, full integration of large UAS operations in the NAS will be achieved. Current large UAS operations will continue to be dependent on COAs, the issuance of NOTAMs, and possibly other measures (e.g., chase plane, segregated airspace) as currently used for accommodated operations. This integration is evolving with UAS technology advances, FAA regulatory changes, NAS automation, communications improvements, and evolving use cases and demand.\n\nNOTE-\nTransponder equipped UAS, during lost link events, if capable, will squawk secondary surveillance radar (SSR)/Transponder code 7400. If the UAS is not programmed for use of SSR code 7400, then code 7600 may be used.\n\nLarge Civil Operations.

The lowest pressure occurs over the upper wing surface and the highest pressure under the wing. This pressure differential triggers the roll up of the airflow at the rear of the wing resulting in swirling air masses trailing downstream of the wing tips. After the roll up is completed, the wake consists of two counter-rotating cylindrical vortices. (See FIG 7-4-1.) The wake vortex is formed with most of the energy concentrated within a few feet of the vortex core.\nFIG 7-4-1Wake Vortex Generation\n\n\nMore aircraft are being manufactured or retrofitted with winglets. There are several types of winglets, but their primary function is to increase fuel efficiency by improving the lift-to-drag ratio. Studies have shown that winglets have a negligible effect on wake turbulence generation, particularly with the slower speeds involved during departures and arrivals."

                "section-content": "Weight, speed, wingspan, and shape of the generating aircraft's wing all govern the strength of the vortex. The vortex characteristics of any given aircraft can also be changed by extension of flaps or other wing configuring devices. However, the vortex strength from an aircraft increases proportionately to an increase in operating weight or a decrease in aircraft speed. Since the turbulence from a \u201cdirty\u201d aircraft configuration hastens wake decay, the greatest vortex strength occurs when the generating aircraft is HEAVY, CLEAN, and SLOW.\n\n\nInduced Roll\n\nIn rare instances, a wake encounter could cause catastrophic inflight structural damage to an aircraft. However, the usual hazard is associated with induced rolling moments that can exceed the roll-control authority of the encountering aircraft. During inflight testing, aircraft intentionally flew directly up trailing vortex cores of larger aircraft. These tests demonstrated that the ability of aircraft to counteract the roll imposed by wake vortex depends primarily on the wingspan and counter-control responsiveness of the encountering aircraft. These tests also demonstrated the difficulty of an aircraft to remain within a wake vortex. The natural tendency is for the circulation to eject aircraft from the vortex.\n\n\nCounter control is usually effective and induced roll minimal in cases where the wingspan and ailerons of the encountering aircraft extend beyond the rotational flow field of the vortex. It is more difficult for aircraft with short wingspan (relative to the generating aircraft) to counter the imposed roll induced by vortex flow. Pilots of short span aircraft, even of the high performance type, must be especially alert to vortex encounters. (See FIG 7-4-2.)\nFIG 7-4-2Wake Encounter Counter Control"

                "section-content": "Trailing vortices have certain behavioral characteristics which can help a pilot visualize the wake location and thereby take avoidance precautions.\n\nAn aircraft generates vortices from the moment it rotates on takeoff to touchdown, since trailing vortices are a by-product of wing lift. Prior to takeoff or touchdown pilots should note the rotation or touchdown point of the preceding aircraft. (See FIG 7-4-3.)\n\n\nThe vortex circulation is outward, upward and around the wing tips when viewed from either ahead or behind the aircraft. Tests with larger aircraft have shown that the vortices remain spaced a bit less than a wingspan apart, drifting with the wind, at altitudes greater than a wingspan from the ground. In view of this, if persistent vortex turbulence is encountered, a slight change of altitude (upward) and lateral position (upwind) should provide a flight path clear of the turbulence.\n\nFlight tests have shown that the vortices from larger aircraft sink at a rate of several hundred feet per minute, slowing their descent and diminishing in strength with time and distance behind the generating aircraft. Pilots should fly at or above the preceding aircraft's flight path, altering course as necessary to avoid the area directly behind and below the generating aircraft. (See FIG 7-4-4.) Pilots, in all phases of flight, must remain vigilant of possible wake effects created by other aircraft. Studies have shown that atmospheric turbulence hastens wake breakup, while other atmospheric conditions can transport wake horizontally and vertically.\n\nWhen the vortices of larger aircraft sink close to the ground (within 100 to 200 feet), they tend to move laterally over the ground at a speed of 2 or 3\u2009knots.  (See .FIG 7-4-5)\nFIG 7-4-3Wake Ends/Wake Begins\nFIG 7-4-4Vortex Flow Field\nFIG 7-4-5Vortex Movement Near Ground - No Wind\nFIG 7-4-6Vortex Movement Near Ground - with Cross Winds\n\nPilots should be alert at all times for possible wake vortex encounters when conducting approach and landing operations. The pilot is ultimately responsible for maintaining an appropriate interval, and should consider all available information in positioning the aircraft in the terminal area, to avoid the wake turbulence created by a preceding aircraft. Test data shows that vortices can rise with the air mass in which they are embedded. The effects of wind shear can cause vortex flow field \u201ctilting.\u201d In addition, ambient thermal lifting and orographic effects (rising terrain or tree lines) can cause a vortex flow field to rise and possibly bounce.\n\n\nA crosswind will decrease the lateral movement of the upwind vortex and increase the movement of the downwind vortex. Thus, a light wind with a cross-runway component of 1 to 5 knots could result in the upwind vortex remaining in the touchdown zone for a period of time and hasten the drift of the downwind vortex toward another runway. (See FIG 7-4-6.) Similarly, a tailwind condition can move the vortices of the preceding aircraft forward into the touchdown zone. THE LIGHT QUARTERING TAILWIND REQUIRES MAXIMUM CAUTION. Pilots should be alert to large aircraft upwind from their approach and takeoff flight paths. (See FIG 7-4-7.)\nFIG 7-4-7Vortex Movement in Ground Effect - Tailwind"

Pilots must be cognizant of their position relative to the traffic and use all means of vertical guidance to ensure they do not fly below the flight path of the wake generating aircraft.\n\nPilots should be particularly alert in calm wind conditions and situations where the vortices could:\n\nRemain in the touchdown area.\n\n\nDrift from aircraft operating on a nearby runway.\n\nSink into the takeoff or landing path from a crossing runway.\n\nSink into the traffic pattern from other airport operations.\n\nSink into the flight path of VFR aircraft operating on the hemispheric altitude 500 feet below.\n\nPilots should attempt to visualize the vortex trail of aircraft whose projected flight path they may encounter. When possible, pilots of larger aircraft should adjust their flight paths to minimize vortex exposure to other aircraft."

                "section-content": "Under certain conditions, airport traffic controllers apply procedures for separating IFR aircraft. If a pilot accepts a clearance to visually follow a preceding aircraft, the pilot accepts responsibility for separation and wake turbulence avoidance. The controllers will also provide to VFR aircraft, with whom they are in communication and which in the tower's opinion may be adversely affected by wake turbulence from a larger aircraft, the position, altitude and direction of flight of larger aircraft followed by the phrase \u201cCAUTION - WAKE TURBULENCE.\u201d After issuing the caution for wake turbulence, the airport traffic controllers generally do not provide additional information to the following aircraft unless the airport traffic controllers know the following aircraft is overtaking the preceding aircraft. WHETHER OR NOT A WARNING OR INFORMATION HAS BEEN GIVEN, HOWEVER, THE PILOT IS EXPECTED TO ADJUST AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS AND FLIGHT PATH AS NECESSARY TO PRECLUDE SERIOUS WAKE ENCOUNTERS. When any doubt exists about maintaining safe separation distances between aircraft during approaches, pilots should ask the control tower for updates on separation distance and aircraft groundspeed.\n\n\nThe following vortex avoidance procedures are recommended for the various situations:\n\nLanding behind a larger aircraft- same runway. Stay at or above the larger aircraft's final approach flight path-note its touchdown point-land beyond it.\n\n\nLanding behind a larger aircraft- when parallel runway is closer than 2,500 feet. Consider possible drift to your runway. Stay at or above the larger aircraft's final approach flight path- note its touchdown point.\n\nLanding behind a larger aircraft- crossing runway. Cross above the larger aircraft's flight path.\n\nLanding behind a departing larger aircraft- same runway. Note the larger aircraft's rotation point- land well prior to rotation point.\n\nLanding behind a departing larger aircraft- crossing runway. Note the larger aircraft's rotation point- if past the intersection- continue the approach- land prior to the intersection. If larger aircraft rotates prior to the intersection, avoid flight below the larger aircraft's flight path. Abandon the approach unless a landing is ensured well before reaching the intersection.\n\nDeparting behind a larger aircraft. Note the larger aircraft's rotation point and rotate prior to the larger aircraft's rotation point. Continue climbing above the larger aircraft's climb path until turning clear of the larger aircraft's wake. Avoid subsequent headings which will cross below and behind a larger aircraft. Be alert for any critical takeoff situation which could lead to a vortex encounter.\n\nIntersection takeoffs- same runway. Be alert to adjacent larger aircraft operations, particularly upwind of your runway. If intersection takeoff clearance is received, avoid subsequent heading which will cross below a larger aircraft's path.\n\nDeparting or landing after a larger aircraft executing a low approach, missed approach, or touch-and-go landing. Because vortices settle and move laterally near the ground, the vortex hazard may exist along the runway and in your flight path after a larger aircraft has executed a low approach, missed approach, or a touch-and-go landing, particular in light quartering wind conditions. You should ensure that an interval of at least 2\u2009minutes has elapsed before your takeoff or landing.\n\nEn route VFR (thousand-foot altitude plus 500 feet). Avoid flight below and behind a large aircraft's path. If a larger aircraft is observed above on the same track (meeting or overtaking) adjust your position laterally, preferably upwind."

Pilots must exercise vigilance in situations where they are responsible for avoiding wake turbulence.\n\n\nPilots are reminded that in operations conducted behind all aircraft, acceptance of instructions from ATC in the following situations is an acknowledgment that the pilot will ensure safe takeoff and landing intervals and accepts the responsibility for providing wake turbulence separation.\n\nTraffic information.\n\n\nInstructions to follow an aircraft; and\n\nThe acceptance of a visual approach clearance.\n\nFor operations conducted behind super or heavy aircraft, ATC will specify the word \u201csuper\u201d or \u201cheavy\u201d as appropriate, when this information is known. Pilots of super or heavy aircraft should always use the word \u201csuper\u201d or \u201cheavy\u201d in radio communications.\n\nSuper, heavy, and large jet aircraft operators should use the following procedures during an approach to landing. These procedures establish a dependable baseline from which pilots of in-trail, lighter aircraft may reasonably expect to make effective flight path adjustments to avoid serious wake vortex turbulence.\n\nPilots of aircraft that produce strong wake vortices should make every attempt to fly on the established glidepath, not above it; or, if glidepath guidance is not available, to fly as closely as possible to a \u201c3-1\u201d glidepath, not above it.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nFly 3,000 feet at 10 miles from touchdown, 1,500 feet at 5 miles, 1,200 feet at 4 miles, and so on to touchdown.\n\nPilots of aircraft that produce strong wake vortices should fly as closely as possible to the approach course centerline or to the extended centerline of the runway of intended landing as appropriate to conditions.\n\nPilots operating lighter aircraft on visual approaches in-trail to aircraft producing strong wake vortices should use the following procedures to assist in avoiding wake turbulence. These procedures apply only to those aircraft that are on visual approaches.\n\nPilots of lighter aircraft should fly on or above\u2009the glidepath. Glidepath reference may be furnished by an ILS, by a visual approach slope system, by other ground-based approach slope guidance systems, or by other means. In the absence of visible glidepath guidance, pilots may very nearly duplicate a 3-degree glideslope by adhering to the \u201c3\u2009to 1\u201d glidepath principle.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nFly 3,000 feet at 10 miles from touchdown, 1,500 feet at 5\u2009miles, 1,200 feet at 4 miles, and so on to touchdown.\n\nIf the pilot of the lighter following aircraft has visual contact with the preceding heavier aircraft and also with the runway, the pilot may further adjust for possible wake vortex turbulence by the following practices:\n\nPick a point of landing no less than 1,000\u2009feet from the arrival end of the runway.\n\n\nEstablish a line-of-sight to that landing point that is above and in front of the heavier preceding aircraft.\n\nWhen possible, note the point of landing of the heavier preceding aircraft and adjust point of intended landing as necessary.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nA puff of smoke may appear at the 1,000-foot markings of the runway, showing that touchdown was that point; therefore, adjust point of intended landing to the 1,500-foot markings.\nMaintain the line-of-sight to the point of intended landing above and ahead of the heavier preceding aircraft; maintain it to touchdown.\n\nLand beyond the point of landing of the preceding heavier aircraft. Ensure you have adequate runway remaining, if conducting a touch-and-go landing, or adequate stopping distance available for a full stop landing.\n\nDuring visual approaches pilots may ask ATC for updates on separation and groundspeed with respect to heavier preceding aircraft, especially when there is any question of safe separation from wake turbulence.\n\nPilots should notify ATC when a wake event is encountered. Be as descriptive as possible (i.e., bank angle, altitude deviations, intensity and duration of event, etc.) when reporting the event. ATC will record the event through their reporting system. You are also encouraged to use the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) to report wake events."

                "section-content": "Air carriers and operators certificated under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 119 are required to use the aeronautical weather information systems defined in the Operations Specifications issued to that certificate holder by the FAA. These systems may utilize basic FAA/National Weather Service (NWS) weather services, contractor- or operator-proprietary weather services and/or Enhanced Weather Information System (EWINS) when approved in the Operations Specifications. As an integral part of this system approval, the procedures for collecting, producing and disseminating aeronautical weather information, as well as the crew member and dispatcher training to support the use of system weather products, must be accepted or approved.\n\n\nOperators not certificated under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 119 are encouraged to use FAA/NWS products through Flight Service Stations, Leidos Flight Service, and/or Flight Information Services-Broadcast (FIS-B).\n\nThe suite of available aviation weather product types is expanding, with the development of new sensor systems, algorithms and forecast models. The FAA and NWS, supported by various weather research laboratories and corporations under contract to the Government, develop and implement new aviation weather product types. The FAA's NextGen Aviation Weather Research Program (AWRP) facilitates collaboration between the NWS, the FAA, and various industry and research representatives.  This collaboration ensures that user needs and technical readiness requirements are met before experimental products mature to operational application.\n\nThe AWRP manages the transfer of aviation weather R&D to operational use through technical review panels and conducting safety assessments to ensure that newly developed aviation weather products meet regulatory requirements and enhance safety.\nFIG 7-1-1Weather Elements Conversion Tables\n\nThe AWRP review and decision-making process applies criteria to weather products at various stages . The stages are composed of the following:\n\nSponsorship of user needs.\n\n\nR & D and controlled testing.\n\nExperimental application.\n\nOperational application.\n\nPilots and operators should be aware that weather services provided by entities other than FAA, NWS, or their contractors may not meet FAA/NWS quality control standards. Hence, operators and pilots contemplating using such services should request and/or review an appropriate description of services and provider disclosure. This should include, but is not limited to, the type of weather product (for example, current weather or forecast weather), the currency of the product (that is, product issue and valid times), and the relevance of the product. Pilots and operators should be cautious when using unfamiliar products, or products not supported by FAA/NWS technical specifications.\n\nNOTE-\nWhen in doubt, consult with a FAA Flight Service Station Specialist.\n\nIn addition, pilots and operators should be aware there are weather services and products available from government organizations beyond the scope of the AWRP process mentioned earlier in this section. For example, governmental agencies such as the NWS and the Aviation Weather Center (AWC), or research organizations such as  the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) display weather \u201cmodel data\u201d and \u201cexperimental\u201d products which require training and/or expertise to properly interpret and use. These products are developmental prototypes that are subject to ongoing research and can change without notice. Therefore, some data on display by government organizations, or government data on display by independent organizations may be unsuitable for flight planning purposes. Operators and pilots contemplating using such services should request and/or review an appropriate description of services and provider disclosure. This should include, but is not limited to, the type of weather product (for example, current weather or forecast weather), the currency of the product (i.e., product issue and valid times), and the relevance of the product. Pilots and operators should be cautious when using unfamiliar weather products.\n\nNOTE-\nWhen in doubt, consult with a FAA Flight Service Station Specialist.\n\nWith increased access to weather products via the public Internet, the aviation community has access to an overwhelming amount of weather information and data that support self-briefing. the Aviation Weather Handbook, FAA-H-8083-28 (current edition), describes the weather products distributed by the NWS. Pilots and operators using the public Internet to access weather from a third party vendor should request and/or review an appropriate description of services and provider disclosure. This should include, but is not limited to, the type of weather product (for example, current weather or forecast weather), the currency of the product (i.e., product issue and valid times), and the relevance of the product. Pilots and operators should be cautious when using unfamiliar weather products and when in doubt, consult with a Flight Service Specialist.\n\nThe development of new weather products, coupled with the termination of some legacy textual and graphical products may create confusion between regulatory requirements and the new products. All flight-related, aviation weather decisions must be based on all available pertinent weather products. As every flight is unique and the weather conditions for that flight vary hour by hour, day to day, multiple weather products may be necessary to meet aviation weather regulatory requirements. Many new weather products now have a Precautionary Use Statement that details the proper use or application of the specific product.\n\nThe FAA has identified three distinct types of weather information available to pilots and operators.\n\nObservations. Raw weather data collected by some type of sensor suite including surface and airborne observations, radar, lightning, satellite imagery, and profilers.\n\n\nAnalysis. Enhanced depiction and/or interpretation of observed weather data.\n\nForecasts. Predictions of the development and/or movement of weather phenomena based on meteorological observations and various mathematical models.\n\nNot all sources of aviation weather information are able to provide all three types of weather information. The FAA has determined that operators and pilots may utilize the following approved sources of aviation weather information:\n\nFederal Government. The FAA and NWS collect raw weather data, analyze the observations, and produce forecasts. The FAA and NWS disseminate meteorological observations, analyses, and forecasts through a variety of systems. In addition, the Federal Government is the only approval authority for sources of weather observations; for example, contract towers and airport operators may be approved by the Federal Government to provide weather observations.\n\n\nEnhanced Weather Information System (EWINS). An EWINS is an FAA authorized, proprietary system for tracking, evaluating, reporting, and forecasting the presence or lack of adverse weather phenomena. The FAA authorizes a certificate holder to use an EWINS to produce flight movement forecasts, adverse weather phenomena forecasts, and other meteorological advisories. For more detailed information regarding EWINS, see the Aviation Weather Services Advisory Circular 00-45 and the Flight Standards Information Management System 8900.1.\n\nCommercial Weather Information Providers. In general, commercial providers produce proprietary weather products based on NWS/FAA products with formatting and layout modifications but no material changes to the weather information itself. This is also referred to as \u201crepackaging.\u201d In addition, commercial providers may produce analyses, forecasts, and other proprietary weather products that substantially alter the information contained in government-produced products. However, those proprietary weather products that substantially alter government-produced weather products or information, may only be approved for use by 14 CFR Part 121 and Part 135 certificate holders if the commercial provider is EWINS qualified.\n\nNOTE-\nCommercial weather information providers contracted by FAA to provide weather observations, analyses, and forecasts (e.g., contract towers) are included in the Federal Government category of approved sources by virtue of maintaining required technical and quality assurance standards under Federal Government oversight."

The website includes observational data, forecasts, and warnings that can be viewed from 14 hours in the past to 15\u2009hours in the future, including thunderstorms, clouds, flight category, precipitation, icing, turbulence, and wind. Hourly model data and forecasts, including information on clouds, flight category, precipitation, icing, turbulence, wind, and graphical output from the National Weather Service's (NWS) National Digital Forecast Data (NDFD) are available. Wind, icing, and turbulence forecasts are available in 3,000\u2009ft increments from the surface up to 30,000 ft MSL, and in 6,000 ft increments from 30,000 ft MSL to 48,000 ft MSL. Turbulence forecasts are also broken into low (below 18,000 ft MSL) and high (at or above 18,000 ft MSL) graphics. A maximum icing graphic and maximum wind velocity graphic (regardless of altitude) are also available. Built with modern geospatial information tools, users can pan and zoom to focus on areas of greatest interest. Target users are commercial and general aviation pilots, operators, briefers, and dispatchers.\n\n\nWeather Products.\n\nThe Aviation Forecasts include gridded displays of various weather parameters as well as NWS textual weather observations, forecasts, and warnings. Icing, turbulence, and wind gridded products are three-dimensional. Other gridded products are two-dimensional and may represent a \u201ccomposite\u201d of a three-dimensional weather phenomenon or a surface weather variable, such as horizontal visibility. The following are examples of aviation forecasts depicted on the GFA:\n\nTerminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)\n\n\nCeiling & Visibility (CIG/VIS)\n\nClouds\n\nPrecipitation / Weather (PCPN/WX)\n\nThunderstorm (TS)\n\nWinds\n\nTurbulence\n\nIce\n\n\nObservations & Warnings (Obs/Warn). The Obs/Warn option provides an option to display weather data for the current time and the previous 14\u2009hours (rounded to the nearest hour). Users may advance through time using the arrow buttons or by clicking on the desired hour. Provided below are the Obs/Warn product tabs available on the GFA website:\n\nMETAR\n\n\nPrecipitation/Weather (PCPN/WX)\n\nCeiling & Visibility (CIG/VIS)\n\nPilot Weather Report (PIREP)\n\nRadar & Satellite (RAD/SAT)\n\nThe GFA will be continuously updated and available online at http://aviationweather.gov/gfa. Upon clicking the link above, select INFO on the top right corner of the map display. The next screen presents the option of selecting Overview, Products, and Tutorial. Simply select the tab of interest to explore the enhanced digital and graphical weather products designed to replace the legacy FA. Users should also refer to the Aviation Weather Handbook, FAA-H-8083-28, Graphical Forecasts for Aviation (GFA) Tool, for more detailed information on the GFA.\n\nGFA Static Images. Some users with limited internet connectivity may access static images via the Aviation Weather Center (AWC) at: http://www.aviationweather.gov/gfa/plot. There are two static graphical images available, titled Aviation Cloud Forecast and Aviation Surface Forecast. The Aviation Cloud Forecast provides cloud coverage, bases, layers, and tops with AIRMETs for mountain obscuration and AIRMETs for icing overlaid. The Aviation Surface Forecast provides visibility, weather phenomena, and winds (including wind gusts) with AIRMETs for instrument flight rules conditions and AIRMETs for sustained surface winds of 30 knots or more overlaid. These images are presented on ten separate maps providing forecast views for the entire contiguous United States (U.S.) on one and nine regional views which provide more detail for the user. They are updated every 3 hours and provide forecast snapshots for 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 hours into the future. (See FIG 7-1-2 and FIG 7-1-3.)\n\nNOTE-\nThe contiguous United States (U.S.) refers to the 48 adjoining U.S. states on the continent of North America that are south of Canada and north of Mexico, plus the District of Columbia. The term excludes the states of Alaska and Hawaii, and all off-shore U.S. territories and possessions, such as Puerto Rico.\nFIG 7-1-2Aviation Surface Forecast\nFIG 7-1-3Aviation Cloud Forecast"

                "section-title": "Preflight Briefing",
                "section-content": "Flight Service is one of the primary sources for obtaining preflight briefings and to file flight plans by phone or the Internet. Flight Service Specialists are qualified and certificated as Pilot Weather Briefers by the FAA. They are not authorized to make original forecasts, but are authorized to translate and interpret available forecasts and reports directly into terms describing the weather conditions which you can expect along your flight route and at your destination. Prior to every flight, pilots should gather all information vital to the nature of the flight. Pilots can receive a regulatory compliant briefing without contacting Flight Service. Pilots are encouraged to use automated resources and review AC 91-92, Pilot's Guide to a Preflight Briefing, for more information. Pilots who prefer to contact Flight Service are encouraged to conduct a self-brief prior to calling. Conducting a self-brief before contacting Flight Service provides familiarity of meteorological and aeronautical conditions applicable to the route of flight and promotes a better understanding of weather information. Three basic types of preflight briefings (Standard, Abbreviated, and Outlook) are available to serve the pilot's specific needs. Pilots should specify to the briefer the type of briefing they want, along with their appropriate background information. This will enable the briefer to tailor the information to the pilot's intended flight. The following paragraphs describe the types of briefings available and the information provided in each briefing.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-1-1, Preflight Preparation, for items that are required.\n\n\n\nStandard Briefing. You should request a Standard Briefing any time you are planning a flight and you have not received a previous briefing or have not received preliminary information through online resources. International data may be inaccurate or incomplete. If you are planning a flight outside of U.S. controlled airspace, the briefer will advise you to check data as soon as practical after entering foreign airspace, unless you advise that you have the international cautionary advisory. The briefer will automatically provide the following information in the sequence listed, except as noted, when it is applicable to your proposed flight.\n\nAdverse Conditions. Significant meteorological and/or aeronautical information that might influence the pilot to alter or cancel the proposed flight; for example,\u2009hazardous weather conditions, airport closures, air traffic delays, etc. Pilots should be especially alert for current or forecast weather that\u2009could reduce flight minimums below VFR or IFR conditions. Pilots should also be alert for any reported or forecast icing if the aircraft is not certified for operating in icing conditions. Flying into areas of\u2009icing or weather below minimums could have disastrous results.\n\n\nVFR Flight Not Recommended. When VFR flight is proposed and sky conditions or visibilities are present or forecast, surface or aloft, that, in the briefer's judgment, would make flight under VFR doubtful, the briefer will describe the conditions, describe the affected locations, and use the phrase \u201cVFR flight not recommended.\u201d This recommendation is advisory in nature. The final decision as to whether the flight can be conducted safely rests solely with the pilot. Upon receiving a \u201cVFR flight not recommended\u201d statement, the non-IFR rated pilot will need to make a \u201cgo or no go\u201d decision. This decision should be based on weighing the current and forecast weather conditions against the pilot's experience and ratings. The aircraft's equipment, capabilities and limitations should also be\u2009considered.\n\nNOTE-\nPilots flying into areas of minimal VFR weather could encounter unforecasted lowering conditions that place the aircraft outside the pilot's ratings and experience level. This could result in spatial disorientation and/or loss of control of the aircraft.\n\nSynopsis. A brief statement describing the type, location and movement of weather systems and/or air masses which might affect the proposed flight.\n\nNOTE-\nThese first 3 elements of a briefing may be combined in any order when the briefer believes it will help to more clearly describe conditions.\n\nCurrent Conditions. Reported weather conditions applicable to the flight will be summarized from all available sources; e.g., METARs/ SPECIs, PIREPs, RAREPs. This element will be omitted if the proposed time of departure is beyond 2 hours, unless the information is specifically requested by the pilot.\n\nEn Route Forecast. Forecast en route conditions for the proposed route are summarized in logical order; i.e., departure/climbout, en route, and descent. (Heights are MSL, unless the contractions \u201cAGL\u201d or \u201cCIG\u201d are denoted indicating that heights are above ground.)\n\nDestination Forecast. The destination forecast for the planned ETA. Any significant changes within 1 hour before and after the planned arrival are included.\n\nWinds Aloft. Forecast winds aloft will be provided in knots and degrees, referenced to true north. The briefer will interpolate wind directions and speeds between levels and stations as necessary to provide expected conditions at planned altitudes. (Heights are MSL.) Temperature information will be provided on request.\n\nNotices to Air Missions (NOTAMs).\n\nAvailable NOTAM (D) information pertinent to the proposed flight, including special use airspace (SUA) NOTAMs for restricted areas, aerial refueling, and night vision goggles (NVG).\n\nNOTE-\nOther SUA NOTAMs (D), such as military operations area\u2009(MOA), military training route (MTR), and warning area NOTAMs, are considered \u201cupon request\u201d briefing items as indicated in paragraph 7-1-4b10(a).\n\n\nProhibited Areas P-40, P-49, P-56, and\u2009the special flight rules area (SFRA) for Washington, DC.\n\nFSS briefers do not provide FDC NOTAM information for special instrument approach procedures unless specifically asked. Pilots authorized by the FAA to use special instrument approach procedures must specifically request FDC NOTAM information for these procedures.\n\nNOTE-\nNOTAM information may be combined with current conditions when the briefer believes it is logical to do so.Airway NOTAMs, procedural NOTAMs, and NOTAMs that are general in nature and not tied to a specific airport/facility (for example, flight advisories and restrictions, open duration special security instructions, and special flight rules areas) are briefed solely by pilot request. For complete flight information, pilots are urged to review the Domestic Notices and International Notices found in the External Links section of the Federal NOTAM System (FNS) NOTAM Search System and the Chart Supplement in addition to obtaining a briefing.\n\nATC Delays. Any known ATC delays and flow control advisories which might affect the proposed flight.\n\nPilots may obtain the following from flight service station briefers upon request:\n\nInformation on SUA and SUA-related airspace, except those listed in paragraph 7-1-4b8.\n\nNOTE-\nFor the purpose of this paragraph, SUA and related airspace includes the following types of airspace: alert area, military operations area (MOA), warning area, and air traffic control assigned airspace (ATCAA). MTR data includes the following types of airspace: IFR training routes (IR), VFR training routes (VR), and slow training routes (SR).Pilots are encouraged to request updated information from ATC facilities while in flight.\n\n\nA review of airway NOTAMs, procedural NOTAMs, and NOTAMs that are general in nature and not tied to a specific airport/facility (for example, flight advisories and restrictions, open duration special security instructions, and special flight rules areas), Domestic Notices and International Notices. Domestic Notices and International Notices are found in the External Links section of the Federal NOTAM System (FNS) NOTAM Search System.\n\nApproximate density altitude data.\n\nInformation regarding such items as air traffic services and rules, customs/immigration procedures, ADIZ rules, search and rescue, etc.\n\nGPS RAIM availability for 1 hour before to 1 hour after ETA or a time specified by the pilot.\n\nOther assistance as required.\n\nAbbreviated Briefing. Request an Abbreviated Briefing when you need information to supplement mass disseminated data, update a previous briefing, or when you need only one or two specific items. Provide the briefer with appropriate background information, the time you received the previous information, and/or the specific items needed. You should indicate the source of the information already received so that the briefer can limit the briefing to the information that you have not received, and/or appreciable changes in meteorological/aeronautical conditions since your previous briefing. To the extent possible, the briefer will provide the information in the sequence shown for a Standard Briefing. If you request only one or two specific items, the briefer will advise you if adverse conditions are present or forecast. (Adverse conditions contain both meteorological and/or aeronautical information.) Details on these conditions will be provided at your request. International data may be inaccurate or incomplete. If you are planning a flight outside of U.S. controlled airspace, the briefer will advise you to check data as soon as practical after entering foreign airspace, unless you advise that you have the international cautionary advisory.\n\nOutlook Briefing. You should request an Outlook Briefing whenever your proposed time of departure is six or more hours from the time of the briefing. The briefer will provide available forecast data applicable to the proposed flight. This type of briefing is provided for planning purposes only. You should obtain a Standard or Abbreviated Briefing prior to departure in order to obtain such items as adverse conditions, current conditions, updated forecasts, winds aloft and NOTAMs, etc.\n\nWhen filing a flight plan only, you will be asked if you require the latest information on adverse conditions pertinent to the route of flight.\n\nInflight Briefing. You are encouraged to conduct a self-briefing using online resources or obtain your preflight briefing by telephone or in person (Alaska only) before departure. In those cases where you need to obtain a preflight briefing or an update to a previous briefing by radio, you should contact the nearest FSS to obtain this information. After communications have been established, advise the specialist of the type briefing you require and provide appropriate background information. You will be provided information as specified in the above paragraphs, depending on the type of briefing requested. En Route advisories tailored to the phase of flight that begins after climb-out and ends with descent to land are provided upon pilot request. Besides Flight Service, there are other resources available to the pilot in flight, including:\n\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). Free traffic, weather, and flight information are available on ADS-B In receivers that can receive data over 978 MHz (UAT) broadcasts. These services are available across the nation to aircraft owners who equip with ADS-B In, with further advances coming from airborne and runway traffic awareness. Even search-and-rescue operations benefit from accurate ADS-B tracking.\n\nFlight Information Services-Broadcast (FIS-B). FIS-B is a free service; but is only available to aircraft that can receive data over 978 MHz (UAT). FIS-B automatically transmits a wide range of weather products with national and regional focus to all equipped aircraft. Having current weather and aeronautical information in the cockpit helps pilots plan more safe and efficient flight paths, as well as make strategic decisions during flight to avoid potentially hazardous weather.\n\nPilots are encouraged to provide a continuous exchange of information on weather, winds, turbulence, flight visibility, icing, etc., between pilots and inflight specialists. Pilots should report good weather as well as bad, and confirm expected conditions as well as unexpected. Remember that weather conditions can change rapidly and that a \u201cgo or no go\u201d decision, as mentioned in paragraph 7-1-4b2, should be assessed at all phases of flight.\n\nFollowing any briefing, feel free to ask for any information that you or the briefer may have missed or are not understood. This way, the briefer is able to present the information in a logical sequence, and lessens the chance of important items being overlooked."

                "section-title": "Inflight Aviation Weather Advisories",
                "section-content": "Inflight Aviation Weather Advisories are forecasts to advise en route aircraft of development of potentially hazardous weather. Inflight aviation weather advisories in the conterminous U.S. are issued by the Aviation Weather Center (AWC) in Kansas City, MO, as well as 20 Center Weather Service Units (CWSU) associated with ARTCCs. AWC also issues advisories for portions of the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, which are under the control of ARTCCs with Oceanic flight information regions (FIRs). The Weather Forecast Office (WFO) in Honolulu issues advisories for the Hawaiian Islands and a large portion of the Pacific Ocean. In Alaska, the Alaska Aviation Weather Unit (AAWU) issues inflight aviation weather advisories along with the Anchorage CWSU. All heights are referenced MSL, except in the case of ceilings (CIG) which indicate AGL.\n\n\nThere are four types of inflight aviation weather advisories: the SIGMET, the Convective SIGMET, the AIRMET, and the Center Weather Advisory (CWA). All of these advisories use VORs, airports, or well-known geographic areas to describe the hazardous weather areas.\n\nThe Severe Weather Watch Bulletins (WWs), (with associated Alert Messages) (AWW) supplements these Inflight Aviation Weather Advisories.\n\nSIGMET. A SIGMET is a concise description of the occurrence or expected occurrence of specified en route weather phenomena which is expected to affect the safety of aircraft operations.\n\nSIGMETs:\n\nAre intended for dissemination to all pilots in flight to enhance safety.\n\n\nAre issued by the responsible MWO as soon as it is practical to alert operators and aircrews of hazardous en route conditions.\n\nAre unscheduled products that are valid for 4 hours; except SIGMETs associated with tropical cyclones and volcanic ash clouds are valid for 6 hours. Unscheduled updates and corrections are issued as necessary.\n\nUse geographical points to describe the hazardous weather areas. These points can reference either VORs, airports, or latitude-longitude, depending on SIGMET location. If the total area to be affected during the forecast period is very large, it could be that, in actuality, only a small portion of this total area would be affected at any one time.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nExample of a SIGMET:\nBOSR WS 050600\nSIGMET ROMEO 2 VALID UNTIL 051000\nME NH VT\nFROM CAR TO YSJ TO CON TO MPV TO CAR \nOCNL SEV TURB BLW 080 EXP DUE TO STG NWLY FLOW.

The U.S. issues a special category of SIGMETs for convective weather called Convective SIGMETs.\n\n\nAre identified by an alphabetic designator from November through Yankee, excluding Sierra and Tango. Issuance for the same phenomenon will be sequentially numbered, using the original designator until the phenomenon ends. For example, the first issuance in the Chicago (CHI) area (reference FIG 7-1-5) for phenomenon moving from the Salt Lake City (SLC) area will be SIGMET Papa 3, if the previous two issuances, Papa 1 and Papa 2, had been in the SLC area. Note that no two different phenomena across the country can have the same alphabetic designator at the same time.\n\nUse location identifiers (either VORs or airports) to describe the hazardous weather areas.\n\nAre issued when the following phenomena occur or are expected to occur:\n\nSevere icing not associated with thunderstorms.\n\n\nSevere or extreme turbulence or clear air turbulence (CAT) not associated with thunderstorms.\n\nWidespread dust storms or sandstorms lowering surface visibilities to below 3 miles.\n\nVolcanic ash.\n\nSIGMETs over Alaska:\n\nAre issued for the Anchorage FIR including Alaska and nearby coastal waters corresponding to the areas described in FIG 7-1-4. and are only for non-convective weather. The U.S. issues a special category of SIGMETs for convective weather called Convective SIGMETs.\n\n\nUse location identifiers (either VORs or airports) to describe the hazardous weather areas.\n\nUse points of latitude and longitude over the ocean areas of the Alaska FIR.\n\nAre identified by an alphabetic designator from India through Mike.\n\nIn addition to the phenomenon applicable to SIGMETs over the contiguous U.S., SIGMETs over Alaska are also issued for:\n\nTornadoes.\n\n\nLines of thunderstorms.\n\nEmbedded thunderstorms.\n\nHail greater than or equal to \u00be inch in diameter.\nFIG 7-1-4Alaska SIGMET and Area Forecast Zones\n\nSIGMETs over oceanic regions (New York Oceanic FIR, Oakland Oceanic FIR including Hawaii, Houston Oceanic FIR, Miami Oceanic FIR, San Juan FIR), points of latitude and longitude are used to describe the hazard area.\n\nSIGMETs over the Oakland Oceanic FIR west of 140 west and south of 30 north (including the Hawaiian Islands) are identified by an alphabetic designator from November through Zulu.\n\n\nSIGMETs over the Oakland Oceanic FIR east of 140 west and north of 30 north are identified by an alphabetic designator from Alpha through Mike.\n\nSIGMETs over the New York Oceanic FIR, Houston Oceanic FIR, Miami Oceanic FIR, and San Juan FIR are identified by an alphabetic designator from Alpha through Mike.\n\nIn addition to SIGMETs issued for the phenomenon for the contiguous U.S., SIGMETs in the oceanic regions are also issued for:\n\nTornadoes.\n\n\nLines of thunderstorms.\n\nEmbedded thunderstorms.\n\nHail greater than or equal to \u00be inch in diameter.\n\nConvective SIGMET\n\nConvective SIGMETs are issued in the conterminous U.S. for any of the following:\n\nSevere thunderstorm due to:\n\nSurface winds greater than or equal to 50 knots.\n\n\nHail at the surface greater than or equal to 3/4 inches in diameter.\n\nTornadoes.\n\n\nEmbedded thunderstorms.\n\nA line of thunderstorms.\n\nThunderstorms producing precipitation greater than or equal to heavy precipitation affecting 40 percent or more of an area at least 3,000 square miles.\n\n\nAny convective SIGMET implies severe or greater turbulence, severe icing, and low-level wind shear. A convective SIGMET may be issued for any convective situation that the forecaster feels is hazardous to all categories of aircraft.\n\nConvective SIGMET bulletins are issued for the western (W), central (C), and eastern (E) United States. (Convective SIGMETs are not issued for Alaska or Hawaii.) The areas are separated at 87 and 107 degrees west longitude with sufficient overlap to cover most cases when the phenomenon crosses the boundaries. Bulletins are issued hourly at H+55. Special bulletins are issued at any time as required and updated at H+55. If no criteria meeting convective SIGMET requirements are observed or forecasted, the message \u201cCONVECTIVE SIGMET... NONE\u201d will be issued for each area at H+55. Individual convective SIGMETs for each area (W, C, E) are numbered sequentially from number one each day, beginning at 00Z. A convective SIGMET for a continuing phenomenon will be reissued every hour at H+55 with a new number. The text of the bulletin consists of either an observation and a forecast or just a forecast. The forecast is valid for up to 2 hours.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nCONVECTIVE SIGMET 44C\nVALID UNTIL 1455Z\nAR TX OK\nFROM 40NE ADM-40ESE MLC-10W TXK-50WNW LFK-40ENE SJT-40NE ADM\nAREA TS MOV FROM 26025KT.

Unscheduled updates and corrections are issued as necessary.\n\nAre intended for dissemination to all pilots in the preflight and en route phase of flight to enhance safety. En route AIRMETs are available over flight service frequencies. Over the contiguous U.S., AIRMETs are also available on equipment intended to display weather and other non-air traffic control-related flight information to pilots using the Flight Information Service-Broadcast (FIS-B). In Alaska and Hawaii, AIRMETs are broadcast on air traffic frequencies.\n\nAre issued for the contiguous U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii.

Additional forecasts may be inserted during the first 6 hours (for example; 01, 02, 04, and 05). 00-hour represents the initial conditions, and the subsequent graphics depict the area affected by the particular hazard at that valid time. Forecasts valid at 00 through 06 hours correspond to the text AIRMET bulletin.\n\nDepict the following en route aviation weather hazards:\n\nInstrument flight rule conditions (ceiling < 1000' and/or surface visibility < 3 miles).\n\n\nWidespread mountain obscuration.\n\nModerate icing.\n\nFreezing levels.\n\nModerate turbulence.\n\nNon-convective low-level wind shear potential below 2,000 feet AGL.\n\nSustained surface winds greater than 30 knots.\n\nInterpolation of time periods between AIRMETs over the contiguous U.S. valid times: Users must keep in mind when using the AIRMET over the contiguous U.S. that if a 00-hour forecast shows no significant weather and a 03-hour forecast shows hazardous weather, they must assume a change is occurring during the period between the two forecasts. It should be taken into consideration that the hazardous weather starts immediately after the 00-hour forecast unless there is a defined initiation or ending time for the hazardous weather. The same would apply after the 03-hour forecast. The user should assume the hazardous weather condition is occurring between the snap shots unless informed otherwise. For example, if a 00-hour forecast shows no hazard, a 03-hour forecast shows the presence of hazardous weather, and a 06-hour forecast shows no hazard, the user should assume the hazard exists from the 0001 hour to the 0559 hour time period.\nFIG 7-1-7AIRMET over the Contiguous U.S.\n\nAIRMETs over Alaska and Hawaii:\n\nAIRMETs over Alaska and Hawaii are in text format.

SPC issues three types of watch notification messages: Aviation Watch Notification Messages, Public Severe Thunderstorm Watch Notification Messages, and Public Tornado Watch Notification Messages.It is important to note the difference between a Severe Thunderstorm (or Tornado) Watch and a Severe Thunderstorm (or Tornado) Warning. A watch means severe weather is possible during the next few hours, while a warning means that severe weather has been observed, or is expected within the hour. Only the SPC issues Severe Thunderstorm and Tornado Watches, while only NWS Weather Forecasts Offices issue Severe Thunderstorm and Tornado Warnings.\nThe Aviation Watch Notification Message. The Aviation Watch Notification Message product is an approximation of the area of the Public Severe Thunderstorm Watch or Public Tornado Watch. The area may be defined as a rectangle or parallelogram using VOR navigational aides as coordinates.\nThe Aviation Watch Notification Message was formerly known as the Alert Severe Weather Watch Bulletin (AWW). The NWS no longer uses that title or acronym for this product. The NWS uses the acronym SAW for the Aviation Watch Notification Message, but retains AWW in the product header for processing by weather data systems.\nEXAMPLE-\nExample of an Aviation Watch Notification Message:\nWWUS30 KWNS 271559\nSAW2\nSPC AWW 271559\nWW 568 TORNADO AR LA MS 271605Z - 280000Z\nAXIS..65 STATUTE MILES EAST AND WEST OF LINE..\n45ESE HEZ/NATCHEZ MS/ - 50N TUP/TUPELO MS/\n..AVIATION COORDS.. 55NM E/W /18WNW MCB - 60E MEM/\nHAIL SURFACE AND ALOFT..3 INCHES.

(Severe thunderstorm criteria are 1-inch hail or larger and/or wind gusts of 50 knots [58 mph] or greater). A Public Severe Thunderstorm Watch Notification Message contains the area description and axis, the watch expiration time, a description of hail size and thunderstorm wind gusts expected, the definition of the watch, a call to action statement, a list of other valid watches, a brief discussion of meteorological reasoning and technical information for the aviation community.\n\nPublic Tornado Watch Notification Messages describe areas where the threat of tornadoes exists. A Public Tornado Watch Notification Message contains the area description and axis, watch expiration time, the term \u201cdamaging tornadoes,\u201d a description of the largest hail size and strongest thunderstorm wind gusts expected, the definition of the watch, a call to action statement, a list of other valid watches, a brief discussion of meteorological reasoning and technical information for the aviation community. SPC may enhance a Public Tornado Watch Notification Message by using the words \u201cTHIS IS A PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION\u201d when there is a likelihood of multiple strong (damage of EF2 or EF3) or violent (damage of EF4 or EF5) tornadoes.\n\nPublic severe thunderstorm and tornado watch notification messages were formerly known as the Severe Weather Watch Bulletins (WW).

MEAN STORM MOTION VECTOR 26045.\nStatus reports are issued as needed to show progress of storms and to delineate areas no longer under the threat of severe storm activity. Cancellation bulletins are issued when it becomes evident that no severe weather will develop or that storms have subsided and are no longer severe.\n\nCenter Weather Advisories (CWAs) \n\nCWAs are unscheduled inflight, flow control, air traffic, and air crew advisory. By nature of its short lead time, the CWA is not a flight planning product. It is generally a nowcast for conditions beginning within the next two hours. CWAs will be issued:\n\nAs a supplement to an existing SIGMET, Convective SIGMET or AIRMET.\n\n\nWhen an Inflight Advisory has not been issued but observed or expected weather conditions meet SIGMET/AIRMET criteria based on current pilot reports and reinforced by other sources of\u2009information about existing meteorological conditions.\n\nWhen observed or developing weather conditions do not meet SIGMET, Convective SIGMET, or AIRMET criteria; e.g., in terms of intensity or area coverage, but current pilot reports or other weather information sources indicate that existing or anticipated meteorological phenomena will adversely affect the safe flow of air traffic within the ARTCC area of responsibility.\n\n\nThe following example is a CWA issued from the Kansas City, Missouri, ARTCC. The \u201c3\u201d after ZKC in the first line denotes this CWA has been issued for the third weather phenomena to occur for the day. The \u201c301\u201d in the second line denotes the phenomena number again (3) and the issuance number (01) for this phenomena. The CWA was issued at 2140Z and is valid until 2340Z.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nZKC3 CWA 032140\nZKC CWA 301 VALID UNTIL 032340\nISOLD SVR TSTM over KCOU MOVG SWWD 10\u2009KTS ETC."

                "section-content": "Data link Service Providers (DSPs). DSPs deploy and maintain airborne, ground-based, and, in some cases, space-based infrastructure that supports the transmission of AI/MET information over one or more physical links. A DSP may provide a free of charge or a for-fee service that permits end users to uplink and downlink AI/MET and other information. The following are examples of DSPs:\n\nFAA FIS-B. A ground-based broadcast service provided through the ADS-B Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) network. The service provides users with a 978 MHz data link capability when operating within range and line-of-sight of a transmitting ground station. FIS-B enables users of properly equipped aircraft to receive and display a suite of broadcast weather and aeronautical information products.\n\n\nNon-FAA FIS Systems. Several commercial vendors provide customers with FIS data over both the aeronautical spectrum and on other frequencies using a variety of data link protocols. Services available from these providers vary greatly and may include tier based subscriptions. Advancements in bandwidth technology permits preflight as well as inflight access to the same MET and AI information available on the ground. Pilots and operators using non-FAA FIS for MET and AI information should be knowledgeable regarding the weather services being provided as some commercial vendors may be repackaging NWS sourced weather, while other commercial vendors may alter the weather information to produce vendor-tailored or vendor-specific weather reports and forecasts.\n\n\nThree Data Link Modes. There are three data link modes that may be used for transmitting AI and MET information to aircraft. The intended use of the AI and/or MET information will determine the most appropriate data link service.\n\nBroadcast Mode: A one-way interaction in which AI and/or MET updates or changes applicable to a designated geographic area are continuously transmitted (or transmitted at repeated periodic intervals) to all aircraft capable of receiving the broadcast within the service volume defined by the system network architecture.\n\n\nContract/Demand Mode: A two-way interaction in which AI and/or MET information is transmitted to an aircraft in response to a specific request.\n\nContract/Update Mode: A two-way interaction that is an extension of the Demand Mode. Initial AI and/or MET report(s) are sent to an aircraft and subsequent updates or changes to the AI and/or MET information that meet the contract criteria are automatically or manually sent to an aircraft.\n\nTo ensure airman compliance with Federal Aviation Regulations, manufacturer's operating manuals should remind airmen to contact ATC controllers, FSS specialists, operator dispatchers, or airline operations control centers for general and mission critical aviation weather information and/or NAS status conditions (such as NOTAMs, Special Use Airspace status, and other government flight information). If FIS products are systemically modified (for example, are displayed as abbreviated plain text and/or graphical depictions), the modification process and limitations of the resultant product should be clearly described in the vendor's user guidance.\n\nOperational Use of FIS. Regardless of the type of FIS system being used, several factors must be considered when using FIS:\n\nBefore using FIS for inflight operations, pilots and other flight crewmembers should become familiar with the operation of the FIS system to be used, the airborne equipment to be used, including its system architecture, airborne system components, coverage service volume and other limitations of the particular system, modes of operation and indications of various system failures. Users should also be familiar with the specific content and format of the services available from the FIS provider(s). Sources of information that may provide this specific guidance include manufacturer's manuals, training programs, and reference guides.\n\n\nFIS should not serve as the sole source of aviation weather and other operational information. ATC, FSSs, and, if applicable, AOCC VHF/HF voice remain as a redundant method of communicating aviation weather, NOTAMs, and other operational information to aircraft in flight. FIS augments these traditional ATC/FSS/AOCC services and, for some products, offers the advantage of being displayed as graphical information. By using FIS for orientation, the usefulness of information received from conventional means may be enhanced. For example, FIS may alert the pilot to specific areas of concern that will more accurately focus requests made to FSS or AOCC for inflight updates or similar queries made to ATC.\n\nThe airspace and aeronautical environment is constantly changing. These changes occur quickly and without warning. Critical operational decisions should be based on use of the most current and appropriate data available. When differences exist between FIS and information obtained by voice communication with ATC, FSS, and/or AOCC (if applicable), pilots are cautioned to use the most recent data from the most authoritative source.\n\nFIS aviation weather products (for example, graphical ground-based radar precipitation depictions) are not appropriate for tactical (typical timeframe of less than 3 minutes) avoidance of severe weather such as negotiating a path through a weather hazard area. FIS supports strategic (typical timeframe of 20 minutes or more) weather decision-making such as route selection to avoid a weather hazard area in its entirety. The misuse of information beyond its applicability may place the pilot and aircraft in jeopardy. In addition, FIS should never be used in lieu of an individual preflight weather and flight planning briefing.\n\nDSPs offer numerous MET and AI products with information that can be layered on top of each other. Pilots need to be aware that too much information can have a negative effect on their cognitive work load. Pilots need to manage the amount of information to a level that offers the most pertinent information to that specific flight without creating a cockpit distraction. Pilots may need to adjust the amount of information based on numerous factors including, but not limited to, the phase of flight, single pilot operation, autopilot availability, class of airspace, and the weather conditions encountered.\n\nFIS NOTAM products, including Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) information, are advisory-use information and are intended for situational awareness purposes only. Cockpit displays of this information are not appropriate for tactical navigation - pilots should stay clear of any geographic area displayed as a TFR NOTAM. Pilots should contact FSSs and/or ATC while en route to obtain updated information and to verify the cockpit display of NOTAM information.\n\nFIS supports better pilot decision-making by increasing situational awareness. Better decision-making is based on using information from a variety of sources. In addition to FIS, pilots should take advantage of other weather/NAS status sources, including, briefings from Flight Service Stations, data from other air traffic control facilities, airline operation control centers, pilot reports, as well as their own observations.\n\nFAA's Flight Information Service-Broadcast (FIS-B).\n\nFIS-B is a ground-based broadcast service provided through the FAA's Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Services Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) network. The service provides users with a 978 MHz data link capability when operating within range and line-of-sight of a transmitting ground station. FIS-B enables users of properly-equipped aircraft to receive and display a suite of broadcast weather and aeronautical information products.\n\n\nTBL 7-1-3 lists the text and graphical products available through FIS-B and provided free-of-charge. Detailed information concerning FIS-B meteorological products can be found in Advisory Circular 00-45, Aviation Weather Services, and AC 00-63, Use of Cockpit Displays of Digital Weather and Aeronautical Information. Information on Special Use Airspace (SUA), Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR), and Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) products can be found in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 of this manual.\n\nUsers of FIS-B should familiarize themselves with the operational characteristics and limitations of the system, including: system architecture; service environment; product lifecycles; modes of operation; and indications of system failure.\n\nNOTE-\nThe NOTAM-D and NOTAM-FDC products broadcast via FIS-B are limited to those issued or effective within the past 30 days. Except for TFRs, NOTAMs older than 30 days are not provided. The pilot in command is responsible for reviewing all necessary information prior to flight.\n\nFIS-B products are updated and transmitted at specific intervals based primarily on product issuance criteria. Update intervals are defined as the rate at which the product data is available from the source for transmission. Transmission intervals are defined as the amount of time within which a new or updated product transmission must be completed and/or the rate or repetition interval at which the product is rebroadcast. Update and transmission intervals for each product are provided in TBL 7-1-3.\n\nWhere applicable, FIS-B products include a look-ahead range expressed in nautical miles (NM) for three service domains: Airport Surface; Terminal Airspace; and En Route/Gulf of Mexico (GOMEX). TBL 7-1-4 provides service domain availability and look-ahead ranging for each FIS-B product.\n\nPrior to using this capability, users should familiarize themselves with the operation of FIS-B avionics by referencing the applicable User's Guides. Guidance concerning the interpretation of information displayed should be obtained from the appropriate avionics manufacturer.\n\nFIS-B malfunctions not attributed to aircraft system failures or covered by active NOTAM should be reported by radio or telephone to the nearest FSS facility, or by sending an email to the ADS-B help desk at adsb@faa.gov. Reports should include:\n\nCondition observed;\n\n\nDate and time of observation;\n\nAltitude and location of observation;\n\nType and call sign of the aircraft; and\n\nType and software version of avionics system.\n\nNon-FAA FIS Systems. Several commercial vendors also provide customers with FIS data over both the aeronautical spectrum and on other frequencies using a variety of data link protocols. In some cases, the vendors provide only the communications system that carries customer messages, such as the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) used by many air carrier and other operators.\n\nOperators using non-FAA FIS data for inflight weather and other operational information should ensure that the products used conform to FAA/NWS standards. Specifically, aviation weather and NAS status information should meet the following criteria:\n\nThe products should be either FAA/NWS \u201caccepted\u201d aviation weather reports or products, or based on FAA/NWS accepted aviation weather reports or products. If products are used which do not meet this criteria, they should be so identified. The operator must determine the applicability of such products to their particular flight operations.\n\n\nIn the case of a weather product which is the result of the application of a process which alters the form, function or content of the base FAA/NWS accepted weather product(s), that process, and any limitations to the application of the resultant product, should be described in the vendor's user guidance material. An example would be a NEXRAD radar composite/mosaic map, which has been modified by changing the scaling resolution. The methodology of assigning reflectivity values to the resultant image components should be described in the vendor's guidance material to ensure that the user can accurately interpret the displayed data.\nTBL 7-1-3FIS-B Over UAT Product Update and Transmission Intervals\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nUpdate Interval1\n\n\nTransmission Interval (95%)2\n\n\nBasic Product\n\n\n\n\nAIRMET\n\n\nAs Available\n\n\n5 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nAWW/WW\n\n\nAs Available, then at 15 minute intervals for 1 hour\n\n\n5 minutes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nCeiling\n\n\nAs Available\n\n\n10 minutes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nConvective SIGMET\n\n\nAs Available, then at 15 minute intervals for 1 hour\n\n\n5 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nD-ATIS\n\n\nAs Available\n\n\n1 minute\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nEcho Top\n\n\n5 minutes\n\n\n5 minutes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nMETAR/SPECI\n\n\n1 minute (where available), As Available otherwise\n\n\n5 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nMRMS NEXRAD (CONUS)\n\n\n2 minutes\n\n\n15 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nMRMS NEXRAD (Regional)\n\n\n2 minutes\n\n\n2.5 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nNOTAMs-D/FDC\n\n\nAs Available\n\n\n10 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nNOTAMs-TFR\n\n\nAs Available\n\n\n10 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nPIREP\n\n\nAs Available\n\n\n10 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nSIGMET\n\n\nAs Available, then at 15 minute intervals for 1 hour\n\n\n5 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nSUA Status\n\n\nAs Available\n\n\n10 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nTAF/AMEND\n\n\n6 Hours (\u00b115 minutes)\n\n\n10 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nTemperature Aloft\n\n\n12 Hours (\u00b115 minutes)\n\n\n10 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nTWIP\n\n\nAs Available\n\n\n1 minute\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nWinds aloft\n\n\n12 Hours (\u00b115 minutes)\n\n\n10 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nLightning strikes 3\n\n\n5 minutes\n\n\n5 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nTurbulence 3\n\n\n1 minute\n\n\n15 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nIcing, Forecast Potential (FIP) 3\n\n\n60 minutes\n\n\n15 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nCloud tops 3\n\n\n30 minutes\n\n\n15 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n1 Minute AWOS 3\n\n\n1 minute\n\n\n10 minutes\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nGraphical-AIRMET 3\n\n\nAs Available\n\n\n5 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nCenter Weather Advisory (CWA) 3\n\n\nAs Available\n\n\n10 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nTemporary Restricted Areas (TRA)\n\n\nAs Available\n\n\n10 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nTemporary Military Operations Areas (TMOA)\n\n\nAs Available\n\n\n10 minutes\n\n\nYes\n\n\n1 The Update Interval is the rate at which the product data is available from the source. \n2 The Transmission Interval is the amount of time within which a new or updated product transmission must be completed (95%) and the rate or repetition interval at which the product is rebroadcast (95%).\n3 The transmission and update intervals for the expanded set of basic meteorological products may be adjusted based on FAA and vendor agreement on the final product formats and performance requirements.\n\nNOTE-\nDetails concerning the content, format, and symbols of the various data link products provided should be obtained from the specific avionics manufacturer.NOTAM-D and NOTAM-FDC products broadcast via FIS-B are limited to those issued or effective within the past 30 days.\nTBL 7-1-4Product Parameters for Low/Medium/High Altitude Tier Radios\n\n\n\nProduct\n\n\nSurface Radios\n\n\nLow Altitude Tier\n\n\nMedium Altitude Tier\n\n\nHigh Altitude Tier\n\n\n\n\nCONUS NEXRAD\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nCONUS NEXRAD not provided\n\n\nCONUS NEXRAD imagery\n\n\nCONUS NEXRAD imagery\n\n\n\n\nWinds & Temps Aloft\n\n\n500 NM look-ahead range\n\n\n500 NM look-ahead range\n\n\n750 NM look-ahead range\n\n\n1,000 NM look-ahead range\n\n\n\n\nMETAR\n\n\n100 NM look-ahead range\n\n\n250 NM look-ahead range\n\n\n375 NM look-ahead range\n\n\nCONUS: CONUS Class B & C airport METARs and 500 NM look-ahead range\n\nOutside of CONUS: 500 NM look-ahead\nrange\n\n\n\n\nTAF\n\n\n100 NM look-ahead range\n\n\n250 NM look-ahead range\n\n\n375 NM look-ahead range\n\n\nCONUS: CONUS Class B & C airport TAFs and 500 NM look-ahead range\n\nOutside of CONUS: 500 NM look-ahead\nrange\n\n\n\n\nAIRMET, SIGMET, PIREP, and SUA/SAA\n\n\n100 NM look-ahead range.

                "section-content": "Manual Observations. With only a few exceptions, these reports are from airport locations staffed by FAA personnel who manually observe, perform calculations, and enter these observations into the (WMSCR) communication system. The format and coding of these observations are contained in paragraph 7-1-28, Key to Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) and Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF).\n\n\nAutomated Weather Observing System (AWOS).\n\nAutomated weather reporting systems are increasingly being installed at airports. These systems consist of various sensors, a processor, a computer\u2010generated voice subsystem, and a transmitter to broadcast local, minute\u2010by\u2010minute weather data directly to the pilot.\n\nNOTE-\nWhen the barometric pressure exceeds 31.00 inches Hg., see AIM, Para 7-2-3, Altimeter Errors.\n\n\nThe AWOS observations will include the prefix \u201cAUTO\u201d to indicate that the data are derived from an automated system. Some AWOS locations will be augmented by certified observers who will provide weather and obstruction to vision information in the remarks of the report when the reported visibility is less than 7 miles. These sites, along with the hours of augmentation, are to be published in the Chart Supplement. Augmentation is identified in the observation as \u201cOBSERVER WEATHER.\u201d The AWOS wind speed, direction and gusts, temperature, dew point, and altimeter setting are exactly the same as for manual observations. The AWOS will also report density altitude when it exceeds the field elevation by more than 1,000 feet. The reported visibility is derived from a sensor near the touchdown of the primary instrument runway. The visibility sensor output is converted to a visibility value using a 10-minute harmonic average. The reported sky condition/ceiling is derived from the ceilometer located next to the visibility sensor. The AWOS algorithm integrates the last 30 minutes of ceilometer data to derive cloud layers and heights. This output may also differ from the observer sky condition in that the AWOS is totally dependent upon the cloud advection over the sensor site.\n\nThese real\u2010time systems are operationally classified into nine basic levels:\n\nAWOS-A only reports altimeter setting;\n\nNOTE-\nAny other information is advisory only.\n\n\nAWOS-AV reports altimeter and visibility;\n\nNOTE-\nAny other information is advisory only.\n\nAWOS-l usually reports altimeter setting, wind data, temperature, dew point, and density altitude;\n\nAWOS-2 provides the information provided by AWOS-l plus visibility; and\n\nAWOS-3 provides the information provided by AWOS-2 plus cloud/ceiling data.\n\nAWOS- 3P provides reports the same as the AWOS 3 system, plus a precipitation identification sensor.\n\nAWOS- 3PT reports the same as the AWOS 3P System, plus thunderstorm/lightning reporting capability.\n\nAWOS- 3T reports the same as AWOS 3 system and includes a thunderstorm/lightning reporting capability.\n\nAWOS- 4 reports the same as the AWOS 3 system, plus precipitation occurrence, type and accumulation, freezing rain, thunderstorm, and runway surface sensors.\n\nThe information is transmitted over a discrete VHF radio frequency or the voice portion of a local NAVAID. AWOS transmissions on a discrete VHF radio frequency are engineered to be receivable to a maximum of 25 NM from the AWOS site and a maximum altitude of 10,000 feet AGL. At many locations, AWOS signals may be received on the surface of the airport, but local conditions may limit the maximum AWOS reception distance and/or altitude. The system transmits a 20 to 30 second weather message updated each minute. Pilots should monitor the designated frequency for the automated weather broadcast. A description of the broadcast is contained in subparagraph c. There is no two\u2010way communication capability. Most AWOS sites also have a dial\u2010up capability so that the minute\u2010by\u2010minute weather messages can be accessed via telephone.\n\nAWOS information (system level, frequency, phone number, etc.) concerning specific locations is published, as the systems become operational, in the Chart Supplement, and where applicable, on published Instrument Approach Procedures. Selected individual systems may be incorporated into nationwide data collection and dissemination networks in the future.\n\nAWOS Broadcasts. Computer\u2010generated voice is used in AWOS to automate the broadcast of the minute\u2010by\u2010minute weather observations. In addition, some systems are configured to permit the addition of an operator\u2010generated voice message; e.g., weather remarks following the automated parameters. The phraseology used generally follows that used for other weather broadcasts. Following are explanations and examples of the exceptions.\n\nLocation and Time. The location/name and the phrase \u201cAUTOMATED WEATHER OBSERVATION,\u201d followed by the time are announced.\n\nIf the airport's specific location is included in the airport's name, the airport's name is announced.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cBremerton National Airport automated weather observation, one four five six zulu;\u201d\n\u201cRavenswood Jackson County Airport automated weather observation, one four five six zulu.\u201d\n\nIf the airport's specific location is not included in the airport's name, the location is announced followed by the airport's name.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cSault Ste.

In these systems, visibility is not announced. \u201cVISIBILITY MISSING\u201d is announced only if the system is configured with a visibility sensor and visibility information is not available.\n\nWeather. In the future, some AWOSs are to be configured to determine the occurrence of precipitation. However, the type and intensity may not always be determined. In these systems, the word \u201cPRECIPITATION\u201d will be announced if precipitation is occurring, but the type and intensity are not determined.\n\nCeiling and Sky Cover.\n\nCeiling is announced as either \u201cCEILING\u201d or \u201cINDEFINITE CEILING.\u201d With the exception of indefinite ceilings, all automated ceiling heights are measured.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cBremerton National Airport automated weather observation, one four five six zulu. Ceiling two thousand overcast;\u201d\n\u201cBremerton National Airport automated weather observation, one four five six zulu. Indefinite ceiling two\u2009hundred, sky obscured.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cClear\u201d is not used in AWOS due to limitations in the height ranges of the sensors. No clouds detected is announced as \u201cNO CLOUDS BELOW XXX\u201d or, in newer systems as \u201cCLEAR BELOW XXX\u201d (where XXX is the range limit of the sensor).\n\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cNo clouds below one two thousand.\u201d\n\u201cClear below one two thousand.\u201d\nA sensor for determining ceiling and sky cover is not included in some AWOS. In these systems, ceiling and sky cover are not announced. \u201cSKY CONDITION MISSING\u201d is announced only if the system is configured with a ceilometer and the ceiling and sky cover information is not available.\n\nRemarks. If remarks are included in the observation, the word \u201cREMARKS\u201d is announced following the altimeter setting.\n\nAutomated \u201cRemarks.\u201d\n\nDensity Altitude.\n\n\nVariable Visibility.\n\nVariable Wind Direction.\n\n\nManual Input Remarks.

The program to install and operate these systems throughout the U.S. is a joint effort of the NWS, the FAA and the Department of Defense. ASOS/AWOS is designed to support aviation operations and weather forecast activities. The ASOS/AWOS will provide continuous minute\u2010by\u2010minute observations and perform the basic observing functions necessary to generate an aviation routine weather report (METAR) and other aviation weather information. The information may be transmitted over a discrete VHF radio frequency or the voice portion of a local NAVAID. ASOS/AWOS transmissions on a discrete VHF radio frequency are engineered to be receivable to a maximum of 25 NM from the ASOS/AWOS site and a maximum altitude of 10,000 feet AGL. At many locations, ASOS/AWOS signals may be received on the surface of the airport, but local conditions may limit the maximum reception distance and/or altitude. While the automated system and the human may differ in their methods of data collection and interpretation, both produce an observation quite similar in form and content. For the \u201cobjective\u201d elements such as pressure, ambient temperature, dew point temperature, wind, and precipitation accumulation, both the automated system and the observer use a fixed location and time\u2010averaging technique. The quantitative differences between the observer and the automated observation of these elements are negligible. For the \u201csubjective\u201d elements, however, observers use a fixed time, spatial averaging technique to describe the visual elements (sky condition, visibility and present weather), while the automated systems use a fixed location, time averaging technique. Although this is a fundamental change, the manual and automated techniques yield remarkably similar results within the limits of their respective capabilities.\n\nSystem Description.\n\nThe ASOS/AWOS at each airport location consists of these main components:\n\nIndividual weather sensors.\n\n\nData collection and processing units.\n\nPeripherals and displays.\n\n\nThe ASOS/AWOS sensors perform the basic function of data acquisition. They continuously sample and measure the ambient environment, derive raw sensor data and make them available to the collection and processing units.\n\n\nEvery ASOS/AWOS will contain the following basic set of sensors:\n\nCloud height indicator (one or possibly three).\n\n\nVisibility sensor (one or possibly three).\n\nPrecipitation identification sensor.\n\nFreezing rain sensor (at select sites).\n\nPressure sensors (two sensors at small airports; three sensors at large airports).\n\nAmbient temperature/Dew point temperature sensor.\n\nAnemometer (wind direction and speed sensor).\n\nRainfall accumulation sensor.\n\nAutomated Lightning Detection and Reporting System (ALDARS) (excluding Alaska and Pacific Island sites).\n\nThe ASOS/AWOS data outlets include:\n\nThose necessary for on\u2010site airport users.\n\n\nNational communications networks.\n\nComputer\u2010generated voice (available through FAA radio broadcast to pilots, and dial\u2010in telephone line).\n\nNOTE-\nWind direction is reported relative to magnetic north in ATIS as well as ASOS and AWOS radio (voice) broadcasts.\n\nAn ASOS/AWOS report without human intervention will contain only that weather data capable of being reported automatically. The modifier for this METAR report is \u201cAUTO.\u201d When an observer augments or backs-up an ASOS/AWOS site, the \u201cAUTO\u201d modifier disappears.\n\nThere are two types of automated stations, AO1 for automated weather reporting stations without a precipitation discriminator, and AO2 for automated stations with a precipitation discriminator. As appropriate, \u201cAO1\u201d and \u201cAO2\u201d must appear in remarks. (A precipitation discriminator can determine the difference between liquid and frozen/freezing precipitation).\n\nNOTE-\nTo decode an ASOS/AWOS report, refer to FIG 7-1-8 and FIG 7-1-9.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nA complete explanation of METAR terminology is located in AIM, Para 7-1-28, Key to Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) and Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR).\n\nFIG 7-1-8Key to Decode an ASOS/AWOS (METAR) Observation (Front)\nFIG 7-1-9Key to Decode an ASOS/AWOS (METAR) Observation (Back)\n\nTBL 7-1-5 contains a comparison of weather observing programs and the elements reported.\n\nService Standards. During 1995, a government/industry team worked to comprehensively reassess the requirements for surface observations at the nation's airports. That work resulted in agreement on a set of service standards, and the FAA and NWS ASOS sites to which the standards would apply. The term \u201cService Standards\u201d refers to the level of detail in weather observation. The service standards consist of four different levels of service (A, B, C, and D) as described below. Specific observational elements included in each service level are listed in TBL 7-1-6.\n\nService Level D defines the minimum acceptable level of service. It is a completely automated service in which the ASOS/AWOS observation will constitute the entire observation, i.e., no additional weather information is added by a human observer. This service is referred to as a stand alone\u2009D site.\n\n\nService Level C is a service in which the human observer, usually an air traffic controller, augments or adds information to the automated observation. Service Level C also includes backup of ASOS/AWOS elements in the event of an ASOS/AWOS malfunction or an unrepresentative ASOS/AWOS report. In backup, the human observer inserts the correct or missing value for the automated ASOS/AWOS elements. This service is provided by air traffic controllers under the Limited Aviation Weather Reporting Station (LAWRS) process, FSS and NWS observers, and, at selected sites, Non-Federal Observation Program observers.\nTwo categories of airports require detail beyond Service Level C in order to enhance air traffic control efficiency and increase system capacity. Services at these airports are typically provided by contract weather observers, NWS observers, and, at some locations, FSS observers.\nService Level B is a service in which weather observations consist of all elements provided under Service Level C, plus augmentation of additional data beyond the capability of the ASOS/AWOS. This category of airports includes smaller hubs or special airports in other ways that have worse than average bad weather operations for thunderstorms and/or freezing/frozen precipitation, and/or that are remote airports.\n\nService Level A, the highest and most demanding category, includes all the data reported in Service Standard B, plus additional requirements as specified. Service Level A covers major aviation hubs and/or high volume traffic airports with average or worse weather.\nTBL 7-1-5Weather Observing Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nASOS\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nAWOS-A\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAWOS-A/V\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAWOS-1\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAWOS-2\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAWOS-3\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAWOS-3P\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAWOS-3T\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAWOS-3P/T\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAWOS-4\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nManual\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCE- FAA Order JO 7900.5, Surface Weather Observing, for element reporting.\n\n\nTBL 7-1-6\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSERVICE LEVEL A\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nService Level\u00a0A consists of all the elements of Service Levels B, C and D plus the elements listed to the right, if observed.\n\n\n10 minute longline RVR at precedented sites or\n\tadditional visibility increments of 1/8, 1/16 and 0 Sector visibility\nVariable sky condition\nCloud layers above 12,000 feet and cloud types\nWidespread dust, sand and other obscurations\nVolcanic eruptions\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSERVICE LEVEL B\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nService Level\u00a0B consists of all the elements of Service Levels C and D plus the elements listed to the right, if observed.\n\n\nLongline RVR at precedented sites\n\u2007(may be instantaneous readout)\nFreezing drizzle versus freezing rain\nIce pellets\nSnow depth & snow increasing rapidly remarks\nThunderstorm and lightning location remarks\nObserved significant weather not at the station\n\tremarks\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSERVICE LEVEL C\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nService Level\u00a0C consists of all the elements of Service Level\u00a0D plus augmentation and backup by a human observer or an air traffic control specialist on location nearby.

                "section-content": "ATC Radar Weather Display.\n\nATC radars are able to display areas of precipitation by sending out a beam of radio energy that is reflected back to the radar antenna when it strikes an object or moisture which may be in the form of rain drops, hail, or snow. The larger the object is, or the more dense its reflective surface, the stronger the return will be presented. Radar weather processors indicate the intensity of reflective returns in terms of decibels (dBZ). ATC systems cannot detect the presence or absence of clouds. The ATC systems can often determine the intensity of a precipitation area, but the specific character of that area (snow, rain, hail, VIRGA, etc.) cannot be determined. For this reason, ATC refers to all weather\u2009areas displayed on ATC radar scopes as \u201cprecipitation.\u201d\n\n\nAll ATC facilities using radar weather processors with the ability to determine precipitation intensity, will describe the intensity to pilots as:\n\n\u201cLIGHT\u201d (< 26 dBZ)\n\n\n\u201cMODERATE\u201d (26 to 40 dBZ)\n\n\u201cHEAVY\u201d (> 40 to 50 dBZ)\n\n\u201cEXTREME\u201d (> 50 dBZ)\n\nNOTE-\nEn route ATC radar's Weather and Radar Processor (WARP) does not display light precipitation intensity.\n\nATC facilities that, due to equipment limitations, cannot display the intensity levels of precipitation, will describe the location of the precipitation area by geographic position, or position relative to the aircraft. Since the intensity level is not available, the controller will state \u201cINTENSITY UNKNOWN.\u201d\n\nARTCC facilities normally use a Weather and Radar Processor (WARP) to display a mosaic of data obtained from multiple NEXRAD sites. There is a time delay between actual conditions and those displayed to the controller. For example, the precipitation data on the ARTCC controller's display could be up to 6 minutes old. When the WARP is not available, a second system, the narrowband Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR) can display two distinct levels of precipitation intensity that will be described to pilots as \u201cMODERATE\u201d (30 to 40 dBZ) and \u201cHEAVY TO EXTREME\u201d ( > 40 dBZ ). The WARP processor is only used in ARTCC facilities.\n\nATC radar is not able to detect turbulence. Generally, turbulence can be expected to occur as the rate of rainfall or intensity of precipitation increases. Turbulence associated with greater rates of rainfall/precipitation will normally be more severe than any associated with lesser rates of rainfall/precipitation. Turbulence should be expected to occur near convective activity, even in clear air. Thunderstorms are a form of convective activity that imply severe or greater turbulence. Operation within 20 miles of thunderstorms should be approached with great caution, as the severity of turbulence can be markedly greater than the precipitation intensity might indicate.\n\n\nWeather Avoidance Assistance.\n\nTo the extent possible, controllers will issue pertinent information on weather or chaff areas and assist pilots in avoiding such areas when requested. Pilots should respond to a weather advisory by either acknowledging the advisory or by acknowledging the advisory and requesting an alternative course of action as follows:\n\nRequest to deviate off course by stating a heading or degrees, direction of deviation, and approximate number of miles. In this case, when the requested deviation is approved, navigation is at the pilot's prerogative, but must maintain the altitude assigned, and remain within the lateral restrictions issued by ATC.\n\n\nAn approval for lateral deviation authorizes the pilot to maneuver left or right within the lateral limits specified in the clearance.\n\nNOTE-\nIt is often necessary for ATC to restrict the amount of lateral deviation (\u201ctwenty degrees right,\u201d \u201cup to fifteen degrees left,\u201d \u201cup to ten degrees left or right of course\u201d).The term \u201cwhen able, proceed direct,\u201d in an ATC weather deviation clearance, refers to the pilot's ability to remain clear of the weather when returning to course/route.\n\nRequest a new route to avoid the affected area.\n\nRequest a change of altitude.\n\nRequest radar vectors around the affected areas.\n\n\nFor obvious reasons of safety, an IFR pilot must not deviate from the course or altitude or flight level without a proper ATC clearance. When weather conditions encountered are so severe that an immediate deviation is determined to be necessary and time will not permit approval by ATC, the pilot's emergency authority may be exercised.\n\nWhen the pilot requests clearance for a route deviation or for an ATC radar vector, the controller must evaluate the air traffic picture in the affected area, and coordinate with other controllers (if ATC jurisdictional boundaries may be crossed) before replying to the request.\n\nIt should be remembered that the controller's primary function is to provide safe separation between aircraft. Any additional service, such as weather avoidance assistance, can only be provided to the extent that it does not derogate the primary function. It's also worth noting that the separation workload is generally greater than normal when weather disrupts the usual flow of traffic. ATC radar limitations and frequency congestion may also be a factor in limiting the controller's capability to provide additional service.\n\nIt is very important, therefore, that the request for deviation or radar vector be forwarded to ATC as far in advance as possible. Delay in submitting it may delay or even preclude ATC approval or require that additional restrictions be placed on the clearance. Insofar as possible the following information should be furnished to ATC when requesting clearance to detour around weather activity:\n\nProposed point where detour will commence.\n\n\nProposed route and extent of detour (direction and distance).\n\nPoint where original route will be resumed.\n\nFlight conditions (IFR or VFR).\n\nAny further deviation that may become necessary as the flight progresses.\n\nAdvise if the aircraft is equipped with functioning airborne radar.\n\nTo a large degree, the assistance that might be rendered by ATC will depend upon the weather information available to controllers. Due to the extremely transitory nature of severe weather situations, the controller's weather information may be of only limited value if based on weather observed on radar only. Frequent updates by pilots giving specific information as to the area affected, altitudes, intensity and nature of the severe weather can be of considerable value. Such reports are relayed by radio or phone to other pilots and controllers and also receive widespread teletypewriter dissemination.\n\nObtaining IFR clearance or an ATC radar vector to circumnavigate severe weather can often be accommodated more readily in the en route areas away from terminals because there is usually less congestion and, therefore, offer greater freedom of action. In terminal areas, the problem is more acute because of traffic density, ATC coordination requirements, complex departure and arrival routes, adjacent airports, etc. As a consequence, controllers are less likely to be able to accommodate all requests for weather detours in a terminal area or be in a position to volunteer such routing to the pilot. Nevertheless, pilots should not hesitate to advise controllers of any observed severe weather and should specifically advise controllers if they desire circumnavigation of observed weather."

A full RVR system consists of:\n\nTransmissometer projector and related items.\n\n\nTransmissometer receiver (detector) and related items.\n\nAnalog recorder.\n\nSignal data converter and related items.\n\nRemote digital or remote display programmer.\n\n\nThe transmissometer projector and receiver are mounted on towers 250 feet apart. A known intensity of light is emitted from the projector and is measured by the receiver. Any obscuring matter such as rain, snow, dust, fog, haze or smoke reduces the light intensity arriving at the receiver. The resultant intensity measurement is then converted to an RVR value by the signal data converter. These values are displayed by readout equipment in the associated air traffic facility and updated approximately once every minute for controller issuance to pilots.\n\nThe signal data converter receives information on the high intensity runway edge light setting in use (step\u20093, 4, or 5); transmission values from the transmissometer and the sensing of day or night conditions. From the three data sources, the system will compute appropriate RVR values.\n\nAn RVR transmissometer established on a 250\u2009foot baseline provides digital readouts to a minimum of 600 feet, which are displayed in 200 foot increments to 3,000 feet and in 500 foot increments from 3,000 feet to a maximum value of 6,000 feet.\n\nRVR values for Category IIIa operations extend down to 700 feet RVR; however, only 600 and 800\u2009feet are reportable RVR increments. The 800\u2009RVR reportable value covers a range of 701 feet to 900 feet and is therefore a valid minimum indication of Category IIIa operations.\n\nApproach categories with the corresponding minimum RVR values.

ATCTs report RVR when the prevailing visibility is 1 mile or less and/or the RVR is 6,000 feet or less.\n\nDetails on the requirements for the operational use of RVR are contained in FAA AC 97-1, Runway Visual Range (RVR). Pilots are responsible for compliance with minimums prescribed for their class of operations in the appropriate CFRs and/or operations specifications.\n\nRVR values are also measured by forward scatter meters mounted on 14-foot frangible fiberglass poles. A full RVR system consists of:\n\nForward scatter meter with a transmitter, receiver and associated items.\n\n\nA runway light intensity monitor (RLIM).\n\nAn ambient light sensor (ALS).\n\nA data processor unit (DPU).\n\nController display (CD).\n\nThe forward scatter meter is mounted on a 14-foot frangible pole. Infrared light is emitted from the transmitter and received by the receiver. Any obscuring matter such as rain, snow, dust, fog, haze or smoke increases the amount of scattered light reaching the receiver. The resulting measurement along with inputs from the runway light intensity monitor and the ambient light sensor are forwarded to the DPU which calculates the proper RVR value. The RVR values are displayed locally and remotely on controller displays.\n\nThe runway light intensity monitors both the runway edge and centerline light step settings (steps\u20091 through 5). Centerline light step settings are used for CAT IIIb operations. Edge Light step settings are used for CAT I, II, and IIIa operations.\n\nNew Generation RVRs can measure and display RVR values down to the lowest limits of Category\u2009IIIb operations (150 feet RVR). RVR values are displayed in 100 feet increments and are reported as follows:\n\n100-feet increments for products below 800\u2009feet.\n\n\n200-feet increments for products between 800 feet and 3,000 feet.\n\n500-feet increments for products between 3,000 feet and 6,500 feet.\n\n25-meter increments for products below 150\u2009meters.\n\n50-meter increments for products between 150 meters and 800 meters.\n\n100-meter increments for products between 800 meters and 1,200 meters.\n\n200-meter increments for products between 1,200 meters and 2,000 meters."

One of the primary duties of the Inflight position is to serve as a collection point for the exchange of PIREPs with en route aircraft.\n\nIf pilots are not able to make PIREPs by radio, reporting upon landing of the inflight conditions encountered to the nearest FSS or Weather Forecast Office will be helpful. Some of the uses made of the reports are:\n\nThe ATCT uses the reports to expedite the flow of air traffic in the vicinity of the field and for hazardous weather avoidance procedures.\n\n\nThe FSS uses the reports to brief other pilots, to provide inflight advisories, and weather avoidance information to en route aircraft.\n\nThe ARTCC uses the reports to expedite the flow of en route traffic, to determine most favorable altitudes, and to issue hazardous weather information within the center's area.\n\nThe NWS uses the reports to verify or amend conditions contained in aviation forecast and advisories. In some cases, pilot reports of hazardous conditions are the triggering mechanism for the issuance of advisories. They also use the reports for pilot weather briefings.\n\nThe NWS, other government organizations, the military, and private industry groups use PIREPs for research activities in the study of meteorological phenomena.\n\nAll air traffic facilities and the NWS forward the reports received from pilots into the weather distribution system to assure the information is made available to all pilots and other interested parties.\n\nThe FAA, NWS, and other organizations that enter PIREPs into the weather reporting system use the format listed in TBL 7-1-8. Items 1 through 6 are included in all transmitted PIREPs along with one or more of items 7 through 13. Although the PIREP should be as complete and concise as possible, pilots should not be overly concerned with strict format or phraseology.

The results are an increase in stall speed and a deterioration of aircraft performance. In extreme cases, 2 to 3 inches of ice can form on the leading edge of the airfoil in less than 5 minutes. It takes but 1/2 inch of ice to reduce the lifting power of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional drag by an equal percentage.\n\n\nA pilot can expect icing when flying in visible precipitation, such as rain or cloud droplets, and the temperature is between +02 and -10 degrees Celsius. When icing is detected, a pilot should do one of two things, particularly if the aircraft is not equipped with deicing equipment; get out of the area of precipitation; or go to an altitude where the temperature is above freezing. This \u201cwarmer\u201d altitude may not always be a lower altitude. Proper preflight action includes obtaining information on the freezing level and the above freezing levels in precipitation areas. Report icing to ATC, and if operating IFR, request new routing or altitude if icing will be a hazard. Be sure to give the type of aircraft to ATC when reporting icing. The following describes how to report icing conditions.\n\nTrace. Ice becomes noticeable. The rate of accumulation is slightly greater than the rate of sublimation. A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is less than \u00bc inch (6 mm) per hour on the outer wing. The pilot should consider exiting the icing conditions before they become worse.\n\n\nLight. The rate of ice accumulation requires occasional cycling of manual deicing systems to minimize ice accretions on the airframe. A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is \u00bc inch to 1 inch (0.6 to 2.5 cm) per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing. The pilot should consider exiting the icing condition.\n\nModerate. The rate of ice accumulation requires frequent cycling of manual deicing systems to minimize ice accretions on the airframe. A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 cm) per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing. The pilot should consider exiting the icing condition as soon as possible.\n\nSevere. The rate of ice accumulation is such that ice protection systems fail to remove the accumulation of ice and ice accumulates in locations not normally prone to icing, such as areas aft of protected surfaces and any other areas identified by the manufacturer. A representative accretion rate for reference purposes is more than 3 inches (7.5 cm) per hour on the unprotected part of the outer wing. By regulation, immediate exit is required.\n\nNOTE-\nSevere icing is aircraft dependent, as are the other categories of icing intensity. Severe icing may occur at any ice accumulation rate when the icing rate or ice accumulations exceed the tolerance of the aircraft.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nPilot report: give aircraft identification, location, time\u2009(UTC), intensity of type, altitude/FL, aircraft type,\u2009indicated air speed (IAS), and outside air temperature\u2009(OAT).\nNOTE-\nRime ice. Rough, milky, opaque ice formed by the instantaneous freezing of small supercooled water droplets.Clear ice. A glossy, clear, or translucent ice formed by the relatively slow freezing of large supercooled water droplets.The OAT should be requested by the FSS or ATC if not included in the PIREP."

                "section-content": "Relatively recent meteorological studies have confirmed the existence of microburst phenomenon. Microbursts are small scale intense downdrafts which, on reaching the surface, spread outward in all directions from the downdraft center. This causes the presence of both vertical and horizontal wind shears that can be extremely hazardous to all types and categories of aircraft, especially at low altitudes. Due to their small size, short life span, and the fact that they can occur over areas without surface precipitation, microbursts are not easily detectable using conventional weather radar or wind shear alert systems.\n\n\nParent clouds producing microburst activity can be any of the low or middle layer convective cloud types. Note, however, that microbursts commonly occur within the heavy rain portion of thunderstorms, and in much weaker, benign appearing convective cells that have little or no precipitation reaching the ground.\nFIG 7-1-13Evolution of a Microburst\n\nThe life cycle of a microburst as it descends in a convective rain shaft is seen in FIG 7-1-13. An important consideration for pilots is the fact that the microburst intensifies for about 5 minutes after it strikes the ground.\n\nCharacteristics of microbursts include:\n\nSize. The microburst downdraft is typically less than 1 mile in diameter as it descends from the cloud base to about 1,000-3,000 feet above the ground. In the transition zone near the ground, the downdraft changes to a horizontal outflow that can extend to approximately 2 1/2 miles in diameter.\n\n\nIntensity. The downdrafts can be as strong as 6,000 feet per minute. Horizontal winds near the surface can be as strong as 45 knots resulting in a 90\u2009knot shear (headwind to tailwind change for a traversing aircraft) across the microburst. These strong horizontal winds occur within a few hundred feet of the ground.\n\nVisual Signs. Microbursts can be found almost anywhere that there is convective activity. They may be embedded in heavy rain associated with a thunderstorm or in light rain in benign appearing virga. When there is little or no precipitation at the surface accompanying the microburst, a ring of blowing dust may be the only visual clue of its existence.\n\nDuration. An individual microburst will seldom last longer than 15 minutes from the time it strikes the ground until dissipation. The horizontal winds continue to increase during the first 5 minutes with the maximum intensity winds lasting approximately 2-4 minutes. Sometimes microbursts are concentrated into a line structure, and under these conditions, activity may continue for as long as an hour. Once microburst activity starts, multiple microbursts in the same general area are not uncommon and should be expected.\nFIG 7-1-14Microburst Encounter During Takeoff\n\nMicroburst wind shear may create a severe hazard for aircraft within 1,000 feet of the ground, particularly during the approach to landing and landing and take\u2010off phases. The impact of a microburst on aircraft which have the unfortunate experience of penetrating one is characterized in FIG 7-1-14. The aircraft may encounter a headwind (performance increasing) followed by a downdraft and tailwind (both performance decreasing), possibly resulting in terrain impact.\nFIG 7-1-15NAS Wind Shear Product Systems\n\nDetection of Microbursts, Wind Shear and Gust Fronts.\n\nFAA's Integrated Wind Shear Detection Plan.\n\nThe FAA currently employs an integrated plan for wind shear detection that will significantly improve both the safety and capacity of the majority of the airports currently served by the air carriers. This plan integrates several programs, such as the Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS), Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR), Weather Systems Processor (WSP), and Low Level Wind Shear Alert Systems (LLWAS) into a single strategic concept that significantly improves the aviation weather information in the terminal area. (See FIG 7-1-15.)\n\n\nThe wind shear/microburst information and warnings are displayed on the ribbon display terminals (RBDT) located in the tower cabs. They are identical (and standardized) in the LLWAS, TDWR and WSP systems, and so designed that the controller does not need to interpret the data, but simply read the displayed information to the pilot. The RBDTs are constantly monitored by the controller to ensure the rapid and timely dissemination of any hazardous event(s) to the pilot.\nFIG 7-1-16LLWAS Siting Criteria\n\nThe early detection of a wind shear/micro-burst event, and the subsequent warning(s) issued to an aircraft on approach or departure, will alert the pilot/crew to the potential of, and to be prepared for, a situation that could become very dangerous! Without these warnings, the aircraft may NOT be able to climb out of, or safely transition, the event, resulting in a catastrophe. The air carriers, working with the FAA, have developed specialized training programs using their simulators to train and prepare their pilots on the demanding aircraft procedures required to escape these very dangerous wind shear and/or microburst encounters.\n\n\nLow Level Wind Shear Alert System (LLWAS).\n\nThe LLWAS provides wind data and software processes to detect the presence of hazardous wind shear and microbursts in the vicinity of an airport. Wind sensors, mounted on poles sometimes as high as 150 feet, are (ideally) located 2,000 - 3,500 feet, but not more than 5,000 feet, from the centerline of the runway. (See FIG 7-1-16.)\nFIG 7-1-17Warning Boxes\n\n\nLLWAS was fielded in 1988 at 110\u2009airports across the nation. Many of these systems have been replaced by new TDWR and WSP technology. While all legacy LLWAS systems will eventually be phased out, 39 airports will be upgraded to LLWAS-NE (Network Expansion) system. The new LLWAS-NE systems not only provide the controller with wind shear warnings and alerts, including wind shear/microburst detection at the airport wind sensor location, but also provide the location of the hazards relative to the airport runway(s). It also has the flexibility and capability to grow with the airport as new runways are built. As many as 32 sensors, strategically located around the airport and in relationship to its runway configuration, can be accommodated by the LLWAS-NE network.\n\nTerminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR).\n\nTDWRs have been deployed at 45\u2009locations across the U.S. Optimum locations for TDWRs are 8 to 12 miles off of the airport proper, and designed to look at the airspace around and over the airport to detect microbursts, gust fronts, wind shifts, and precipitation intensities. TDWR products advise the controller of wind shear and microburst events impacting all runways and the areas\u00a01/2\u00a0mile on either side of the extended centerline of the runways out to 3 miles on final approach and 2 miles out on departure. (FIG 7-1-17 is a theoretical view of the warning boxes, including the runway, that the software uses in determining the location(s) of wind shear or microbursts). These warnings are displayed (as depicted in the examples in subparagraph 5) on the RBDT.\n\n\nIt is very important to understand what TDWR does NOT DO:\n\nIt\u2007DOES NOT warn of wind shear outside of the alert boxes (on the arrival and departure ends of the runways);\n\n\nIt\u2007DOES NOT detect wind shear that is NOT a microburst or a gust front;\n\nIt\u2007DOES NOT detect gusty or cross wind conditions; and\n\nIt DOES NOT detect turbulence.\nHowever, research and development is continuing on these systems. Future improvements may include such areas as storm motion (movement), improved gust front detection, storm growth and decay, microburst prediction, and turbulence detection.\nTDWR also provides a geographical situation display (GSD) for supervisors and traffic management specialists for planning purposes. The GSD displays (in color) 6 levels of weather (precipitation), gust fronts and predicted storm movement(s). This data is used by the tower supervisor(s), traffic management specialists and controllers to plan for runway changes and arrival/departure route changes in order to both reduce aircraft delays and increase airport capacity.\n\nWeather Systems Processor (WSP).\n\nThe WSP provides the controller, supervisor, traffic management specialist, and ultimately the pilot, with the same products as the terminal doppler weather radar (TDWR) at a fraction of the cost of a TDWR. This is accomplished by utilizing new technologies to access the weather channel capabilities of the existing ASR-9 radar located on or near the airport, thus eliminating the requirements for a separate radar location, land acquisition, support facilities and the associated communication landlines and expenses.\n\n\nThe WSP utilizes the same RBDT display as the TDWR and LLWAS, and, just like TDWR, also has a GSD for planning purposes by supervisors, traffic management specialists and controllers. The WSP GSD emulates the TDWR display, i.e., it also depicts 6 levels of precipitation, gust fronts and predicted storm movement, and like the TDWR GSD, is used to plan for runway changes and arrival/departure route changes in order to reduce aircraft delays and to increase airport capacity.\n\nThis system is installed at 34\u2009airports across the nation, substantially increasing the safety of flying.\n\nOperational aspects of LLWAS, TDWR and WSP.\nTo demonstrate how this data is used by both the controller and the pilot, 3 ribbon display examples and their explanations are presented:\nMICROBURST ALERTS\n\nEXAMPLE-\nThis is what the controller sees on his/her ribbon display in the tower cab.\n\n\n27A MBA 35K- 2MF 250 20\n\n\n\nNOTE-\n(See FIG 7-1-18 to see how the TDWR/WSP determines the microburst location).\nThis is what the controller will say when issuing the alert.\n\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY 27 ARRIVAL, MICROBURST ALERT, 35 KT LOSS 2 MILE FINAL, THRESHOLD WIND 250 AT 20.\nIn plain language, the controller is telling the pilot that on approach to runway 27, there is a microburst alert on the approach lane to the runway, and to anticipate or expect a 35 knot loss of airspeed at approximately 2 miles out on final approach (where it will first encounter the phenomena). With that information, the aircrew is forewarned, and should be prepared to apply wind shear/microburst escape procedures should they decide to continue the approach. Additionally, the surface winds at the airport for landing runway 27 are reported as 250\u2009degrees at 20 knots.\n\nNOTE-\nThreshold wind is at pilot's request or as deemed appropriate by the controller.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-8b2(a), Air Traffic Control, Low Level Wind Shear/Microburst Advisories.\n\nFIG 7-1-18Microburst Alert\n\n\nWIND SHEAR ALERTS\n\nEXAMPLE-\nThis is what the controller sees on his/her ribbon display in the tower cab.\n\n\n27A WSA 20K- 3MF  200 15\n\n\n\nNOTE-\n(See FIG 7-1-19 to see how the TDWR/WSP determines the wind shear location).\nThis is what the controller will say when issuing the alert.\n\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nRUNWAY 27 ARRIVAL, WIND SHEAR ALERT, 20 KT LOSS 3 MILE FINAL, THRESHOLD WIND 200 AT 15.\nIn plain language, the controller is advising the aircraft arriving on runway 27 that at about 3 miles out they can expect to encounter a wind shear condition that will decrease their airspeed by 20 knots and possibly encounter turbulence. Additionally, the airport surface winds for landing runway 27 are reported as 200 degrees at 15 knots.\n\nNOTE-\nThreshold wind is at pilot's request or as deemed appropriate by the controller.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 3-1-8, Low Level Wind Shear/Microburst Advisories, Subpara b2(a).\n\nFIG 7-1-19Weak Microburst Alert\nFIG 7-1-20Gust Front Alert\n\nMULTIPLE WIND SHEAR ALERTS\n\nEXAMPLE-\nThis is what the controller sees on his/her ribbon display in the tower cab.\n\n\n27A WSA 20K+ RWY  250 20\n\n\n\n\n27D WSA 20K+ RWY  250 20\n\n\n\nNOTE-\n(See FIG 7-1-20 to see how the TDWR/WSP determines the gust front/wind shear location.)\nThis is what the controller will say when issuing the alert.\n\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nMULTIPLE WIND SHEAR ALERTS. RUNWAY 27 ARRIVAL, WIND SHEAR ALERT, 20 KT GAIN ON RUNWAY; RUNWAY 27 DEPARTURE, WIND SHEAR ALERT, 20 KT GAIN ON RUNWAY, WIND 250 AT 20.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nIn this example, the controller is advising arriving and departing aircraft that they could encounter a wind shear condition right on the runway due to a gust front (significant change of wind direction) with the possibility of a 20 knot gain in airspeed associated with the gust front. Additionally, the airport surface winds (for the runway in use) are reported as 250 degrees at 20 knots.\nREFERENCE-\n\nFAA Order 7110.65, Para 3-1-8, Low Level Wind Shear/Microburst Advisories, Subpara b2(d).\n\n\nThe Terminal Weather Information for Pilots System (TWIP).\n\nWith the increase in the quantity and quality of terminal weather information available through TDWR, the next step is to provide this information directly to pilots rather than relying on voice communications from ATC. The NAS has long been in need of a means of delivering terminal weather information to the cockpit more efficiently in terms of both speed and accuracy to enhance pilot awareness of weather hazards and reduce air traffic controller workload. With the TWIP capability, terminal weather information, both alphanumerically and graphically, is now available directly to the cockpit for 46 airports in the U.S. NAS. (See FIG 7-1-21.)\nFIG 7-1-21TWIP Image of Convective Weather at MCO International\n\n\nTWIP products are generated using weather data from the TDWR or the Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS). These products can then be accessed by pilots using the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) data link services. Airline dispatchers can also access this database and send messages to specific aircraft whenever wind shear activity begins or ends at an airport.\n\nTWIP products include descriptions and character graphics of microburst alerts, wind shear alerts, significant precipitation, convective activity within 30 NM surrounding the terminal area, and expected weather that will impact airport operations. During inclement weather, i.e., whenever a predetermined level of precipitation or wind shear is detected within 15 miles of the terminal area, TWIP products are updated once each minute for text messages and once every five minutes for character graphic messages. During good weather (below the predetermined precipitation or wind shear parameters) each message is updated every 10 minutes. These products are intended to improve the situational awareness of the pilot/flight crew, and to aid in flight planning prior to arriving or departing the terminal area. It is important to understand that, in the context of TWIP,  the predetermined levels for inclement versus good weather has nothing to do with the criteria for VFR/MVFR/IFR/LIFR; it only deals with precipitation, wind shears and microbursts.\nTBL 7-1-12TWIP-Equipped Airports\n\n\n\nAirport\n\n\nIdentifier\n\n\n\n\nAndrews AFB, MD\n\n\nKADW\n\n\n\n\nHartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Intl Airport\n\n\nKATL\n\n\n\n\nNashville Intl Airport\n\n\nKBNA\n\n\n\n\nLogan Intl Airport\n\n\nKBOS\n\n\n\n\nBaltimore/Washington Intl Airport\n\n\nKBWI\n\n\n\n\nHopkins Intl Airport\n\n\nKCLE\n\n\n\n\nCharlotte/Douglas Intl Airport\n\n\nKCLT\n\n\n\n\nPort Columbus Intl Airport\n\n\nKCMH\n\n\n\n\nCincinnati/Northern Kentucky Intl Airport\n\n\nKCVG\n\n\n\n\nDallas Love Field Airport\n\n\nKDAL\n\n\n\n\nJames M.

                "section-content": "Volcanic eruptions which send ash into the upper atmosphere occur somewhere around the world several times each year. Flying into a volcanic ash cloud can be extremely dangerous. At least two B747s have lost all power in all four engines after such an encounter. Regardless of the type aircraft, some damage is almost certain to ensue after an encounter with a volcanic ash cloud. Additionally, studies have shown that volcanic eruptions are the only significant source of large quantities of sulphur dioxide (SO2) gas at jet-cruising altitudes. Therefore, the detection and subsequent reporting of SO2 is of significant importance. Although SO2 is colorless, its presence in the atmosphere should be suspected when a sulphur-like or rotten egg odor is present throughout the cabin.\n\n\nWhile some volcanoes in the U.S. are monitored, many in remote areas are not. These unmonitored volcanoes may erupt without prior warning to the aviation community. A pilot observing a volcanic eruption who has not had previous notification of it may be the only witness to the eruption. Pilots are strongly encouraged to transmit a PIREP regarding volcanic eruptions and any observed volcanic ash clouds or detection of sulphur dioxide (SO2) gas associated with volcanic activity.\n\nPilots should submit PIREPs regarding volcanic activity using the Volcanic Activity Reporting (VAR) form as illustrated in Appendix 2. If a VAR form is not immediately available, relay enough information to identify the position and type of volcanic activity.\n\nPilots should verbally transmit the data required in items 1 through 8 of the VAR as soon as possible. The data required in items 9 through 16 of the VAR should be relayed after landing if possible."

                "section-content": "Turbulence, hail, rain, snow, lightning, sustained updrafts and downdrafts, icing conditions-all are present in thunderstorms. While there is some evidence that maximum turbulence exists at the middle level of a thunderstorm, recent studies show little variation of turbulence intensity with altitude.\n\n\nThere is no useful correlation between the external visual appearance of thunderstorms and the severity or amount of turbulence or hail within them. The visible thunderstorm cloud is only a portion of a turbulent system whose updrafts and downdrafts often extend far beyond the visible storm cloud. Severe turbulence can be expected up to 20 miles from severe thunderstorms. This distance decreases to about 10 miles in less severe storms.\n\nWeather radar, airborne or ground based, will normally reflect the areas of moderate to heavy precipitation (radar does not detect turbulence). The frequency and severity of turbulence generally increases with the radar reflectivity which is closely associated with the areas of highest liquid water content of the storm. NO FLIGHT PATH THROUGH AN AREA OF STRONG OR VERY STRONG RADAR ECHOES SEPARATED BY 20-30 MILES OR LESS MAY BE CONSIDERED FREE OF SEVERE TURBULENCE.\n\nTurbulence beneath a thunderstorm should not be minimized. This is especially true when the relative humidity is low in any layer between the surface and 15,000 feet. Then the lower altitudes may be characterized by strong out flowing winds and severe turbulence.\n\nThe probability of lightning strikes occurring to aircraft is greatest when operating at altitudes where temperatures are between minus 5 degrees Celsius and plus 5 degrees Celsius. Lightning can strike aircraft flying in the clear in the vicinity of a thunderstorm.\n\nMETAR reports do not include a descriptor for severe thunderstorms. However, by understanding severe thunderstorm criteria, i.e., 50 knot winds or 3/4\u2009inch hail, the information is available in the report to know that one is occurring.\n\nCurrent weather radar systems are able to objectively determine precipitation intensity.

                "section-content": "Thunderstorm Avoidance. Never regard any thunderstorm lightly, even when radar echoes are of light intensity. Avoiding thunderstorms is the best policy. Following are some Do's and Don'ts of thunderstorm avoidance:\n\nDon't land or takeoff in the face of an approaching thunderstorm. A sudden gust front of low level turbulence could cause loss of control.\n\n\nDon't attempt to fly under a thunderstorm even if you can see through to the other side. Turbulence and wind shear under the storm could be hazardous.\n\nDon't attempt to fly under the anvil of a thunderstorm. There is a potential for severe and extreme clear air turbulence.\n\nDon't fly without airborne radar into a cloud mass containing scattered embedded thunderstorms. Scattered thunderstorms not embedded usually can be visually circumnavigated.\n\nDon't trust the visual appearance to be a reliable indicator of the turbulence inside a thunderstorm.\n\nDon't assume that ATC will offer radar navigation guidance or deviations around thunderstorms.\n\nDon't use data-linked weather next generation weather radar (NEXRAD) mosaic imagery as the sole means for negotiating a path through a thunderstorm area (tactical maneuvering).\n\nDo remember that the data-linked NEXRAD mosaic imagery shows where the weather was, not where the weather is. The weather conditions depicted may be 15 to 20 minutes older than indicated on the display.\n\nDo listen to chatter on the ATC frequency for Pilot Weather Reports (PIREP) and other aircraft requesting to deviate or divert.\n\nDo ask ATC for radar navigation guidance or to approve deviations around thunderstorms, if needed.\n\nDo use data-linked weather NEXRAD mosaic imagery (for example, Flight Information Service-Broadcast (FIS-B)) for route selection to avoid thunderstorms entirely (strategic maneuvering).\n\nDo advise ATC, when switched to another controller, that you are deviating for thunderstorms before accepting to rejoin the original route.\n\nDo ensure that after an authorized weather deviation, before accepting to rejoin the original route, that the route of flight is clear of thunderstorms.\n\nDo avoid by at least 20 miles any thunderstorm identified as severe or giving an intense radar echo. This is especially true under the anvil of a large cumulonimbus.\n\nDo circumnavigate the entire area if the area has 6/10 thunderstorm coverage.\n\nDo remember that vivid and frequent lightning indicates the probability of a severe thunderstorm.\n\nDo regard as extremely hazardous any thunderstorm with tops 35,000 feet or higher whether the top is visually sighted or determined by radar.\n\nDo give a PIREP for the flight conditions.\n\nDo divert and wait out the thunderstorms on the ground if unable to navigate around an area of thunderstorms.\n\nDo contact Flight Service for assistance in avoiding thunderstorms. Flight Service specialists have NEXRAD mosaic radar imagery and NEXRAD single site radar with unique features such as base and composite reflectivity, echo tops, and VAD wind profiles.\n\n\nIf you cannot avoid penetrating a thunderstorm, following are some Do's before entering the storm:\n\nTighten your safety belt, put on your shoulder harness (if installed), if and secure all loose objects.\n\n\nPlan and hold the course to take the aircraft through the storm in a minimum time.\n\nTo avoid the most critical icing, establish a penetration altitude below the freezing level or above the level of -15\u00baC.\n\nVerify that pitot heat is on and turn on carburetor heat or jet engine anti-ice. Icing can be rapid at any altitude and cause almost instantaneous power failure and/or loss of airspeed indication.\n\nEstablish power settings for turbulence penetration airspeed recommended in the aircraft manual.\n\nTurn up cockpit lights to highest intensity to lessen temporary blindness from lightning.\n\nIf using automatic pilot, disengage Altitude Hold Mode and Speed Hold Mode. The automatic altitude and speed controls will increase maneuvers of the aircraft thus increasing structural stress.\n\nIf using airborne radar, tilt the antenna up and down occasionally. This will permit the detection of other thunderstorm activity at altitudes other than the one being flown.\n\nFollowing are some Do's and Don'ts during the thunderstorm penetration:\n\nDo keep your eyes on your instruments. Looking outside the cockpit can increase danger of temporary blindness from lightning.\n\n\nDon't change power settings; maintain settings for the recommended turbulence penetration airspeed.\n\nDo maintain constant attitude. Allow the altitude and airspeed to fluctuate.\n\nDon't turn back once you are in the thunderstorm. A straight course through the storm most likely will get the aircraft out of the hazards most quickly. In addition, turning maneuvers increase stress on the aircraft."

However, temperature and dew point will be reported in degrees Celsius. The U.S reports prevailing visibility rather than lowest sector visibility. The elements in the body of a METAR report are separated with a space. The only exceptions are RVR, temperature, and dew point which are separated with a solidus (/). When an element does not occur, or cannot be observed, the preceding space and that element are omitted from that particular report. A METAR report contains the following sequence of elements in the following order:\n\nType of report.\n\n\nICAO Station Identifier.\n\nDate and time of report.\n\nModifier (as required).\n\nWind.\n\nVisibility.\n\nRunway Visual Range (RVR).\n\nWeather phenomena.\n\nSky conditions.\n\nTemperature/dew point group.\n\nAltimeter.\n\nRemarks (RMK).\n\n\nThe following paragraphs describe the elements in a METAR report.\n\nType of report.

If \u201cAUTO\u201d is shown in the body of the report, the type of sensor equipment used at the station will be encoded in the remarks section of the report. The absence of \u201cAUTO\u201d indicates that a report was made manually by an observer or that an automated report had human augmentation/backup. The modifier \u201cCOR\u201d indicates a corrected report that is sent out to replace an earlier report with an error.\n\nNOTE-\nThere are two types of automated stations, AO1 for automated weather reporting stations without a precipitation discriminator, and AO2 for automated stations with a precipitation discriminator. (A precipitation discriminator can determine the difference between liquid and frozen/freezing precipitation). This information appears in the remarks section of an automated report.\n\nWind. The wind is reported as a five digit group (six digits if speed is over 99 knots). The first three digits are the direction the wind is blowing from, in tens of degrees referenced to true north, or \u201cVRB\u201d if the direction is variable. The next two digits is the wind speed in knots, or if over 99 knots, the next three digits. If the wind is gusty, it is reported as a \u201cG\u201d after the speed followed by the highest gust reported. The abbreviation \u201cKT\u201d is appended to denote the use of knots for wind speed.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n13008KT - wind from 130 degrees at 8 knots\n08032G45KT - wind from 080 degrees at 32 knots with gusts to 45 knots\nVRB04KT - wind variable in direction at 4 knots\n00000KT - wind calm\n210103G130KT - wind from 210 degrees at 103 knots with gusts to 130 knots\nIf the wind direction is variable by 60 degrees or more and the speed is greater than 6 knots, a variable group consisting of the extremes of the wind direction separated by a \u201cv\u201d will follow the prevailing wind group.\n32012G22KT 280V350\nPeak Wind. Whenever the peak wind exceeds 25 knots \u201cPK WND\u201d will be included in Remarks, e.g., PK WND 28045/1955 \u201cPeak wind two eight zero at four five occurred at one niner five five.\u201d If the hour can be inferred from the report time, only the minutes will be appended, e.g., PK WND 34050/38 \u201cPeak wind three four zero at five zero occurred at three eight past the hour.\u201d\n\n\nWind shift. Whenever a wind shift occurs, \u201cWSHFT\u201d will be included in remarks followed by the time the wind shift began, e.g., WSHFT 30 FROPA \u201cWind shift at three zero due to frontal passage.\u201d\n\nVisibility. Prevailing visibility is reported in statute miles with \u201cSM\u201d appended to it.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n7SM - seven statute miles\n15SM - fifteen statute miles\n1/2SM - one-half statute mile\nTower/surface visibility. If either visibility (tower or surface) is below four statute miles, the lesser of the two will be reported in the body of the report; the greater will be reported in remarks.\n\n\nAutomated visibility. ASOS/AWOS visibility stations will show visibility 10 or greater than 10 miles as \u201c10SM.\u201d AWOS visibility stations will show visibility less than 1/4 statute mile as \u201cM1/4SM\u201d and visibility 10 or greater than 10 miles as \u201c10SM.\u201d\n\nNOTE-\nAutomated sites that are augmented by human observer to meet service level requirements can report 0, 1/16 SM, and 1/8 SM visibility increments.\n\nVariable visibility. Variable visibility is shown in remarks (when rapid increase or decrease by 1/2 statute mile or more and the average prevailing visibility is less than three miles) e.g., VIS 1V2 \u201cvisibility variable between one and two.\u201d\n\nSector visibility. Sector visibility is shown in remarks when it differs from the prevailing visibility, and either the prevailing or sector visibility is less than three miles.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nVIS N2 - visibility north two\nRunway Visual Range (When Reported). \u201cR\u201d identifies the group followed by the runway heading (and parallel runway designator, if needed) \u201c/\u201d and the visual range in feet (meters in other countries) followed with \u201cFT\u201d (feet is not spoken).\n\nVariability Values. When RVR varies (by more than on reportable value), the lowest and highest values are shown with \u201cV\u201d between them.\n\n\nMaximum/Minimum Range. \u201cP\u201d indicates an observed RVR is above the maximum value for this system (spoken as \u201cmore than\u201d). \u201cM\u201d indicates an observed RVR is below the minimum value which can be determined by the system (spoken as \u201cless than\u201d).\n\nEXAMPLE-\nR32L/1200FT - runway three two left R-V-R one thousand two hundred.\nR27R/M1000V4000FT - runway two seven right R-V-R variable from less than one thousand to four thousand.\nWeather Phenomena. The weather as reported in the METAR code represents a significant change in the way weather is currently reported. In METAR, weather is reported in the format:\nIntensity/Proximity/Descriptor/Precipitation/Obstruction to visibility/Other\nNOTE-\nThe \u201c/\u201d above and in the following descriptions (except as the separator between the temperature and dew point) are for separation purposes in this publication and do not appear in the actual METARs.\n\nIntensity applies only to the first type of precipitation reported. A \u201c-\u201d denotes light, no symbol denotes moderate, and a \u201c+\u201d denotes heavy.\n\n\nProximity applies to and reported only for weather occurring in the vicinity of the airport (between 5 and 10 miles of the point(s) of observation). It is denoted by the letters \u201cVC.\u201d (Intensity and \u201cVC\u201d will not appear together in the weather group).\n\nDescriptor. These eight descriptors apply to the precipitation or obstructions to visibility: \n\nTSthunderstormDRlow driftingSHshowersMIshallowFZfreezingBCpatchesBLblowingPRpartial\nNOTE-\nAlthough \u201cTS\u201d and \u201cSH\u201d are used with precipitation and may be preceded with an intensity symbol, the intensity still applies to the precipitation, not the descriptor.\n\nPrecipitation. There are nine types of precipitation in the METAR code: \n\nRArainDZdrizzleSNsnowGRhail (1/4\u201d or greater)GSsmall hail/snow pelletsPLice pelletsSGsnow grainsICice crystals (diamond dust)UPunknown precipitation (automated stations only)\nObstructions to visibility. There are eight types of obscuration phenomena in the METAR code (obscurations are any phenomena in the atmosphere, other than precipitation, that reduce horizontal visibility): \n\nFG fog (vsby less than 5/8 mile)HZhazeFUsmokePYsprayBRmist (vsby 5/8 - 6 miles)SAsandDUdustVAvolcanic ash\nNOTE-\nFog (FG) is observed or forecast only when the visibility is less than five-eighths of mile, otherwise mist (BR) is observed or forecast.\n\nOther. There are five categories of other weather phenomena which are reported when they occur: \n\nSQsquallSSsandstormDSduststormPOdust/sand whirlsFCfunnel cloud+FCtornado/waterspoutEXAMPLES-TSRAthunderstorm with moderate rain+SNheavy snow-RA FGlight rain and fogBRHZmist and haze (visibility 5/8 mile or greater)FZDZfreezing drizzleVCSHrain shower in the vicinity+SHRASNPLheavy rain showers, snow, ice pellets (intensity indicator refers to the predominant rain)\nSky Condition. The sky condition as reported in METAR represents a significant change from the way sky condition is currently reported. In METAR, sky condition is reported in the format:\n\nAmount/Height/(Type) or Indefinite Ceiling/Height\n\nAmount. The amount of sky cover is reported in eighths of sky cover, using the contractions: \n\nSKCclear (no clouds)FEW>0 to 2/8SCTscattered (3/8s to 4/8s of clouds)BKNbroken (5/8s to 7/8s of clouds)OVCovercast (8/8s clouds)CBCumulonimbus when presentTCUTowering cumulus when present\nNOTE-\n\u201cSKC\u201d will be reported at manual stations. \u201cCLR\u201d will be used at automated stations when no clouds below 12,000 feet are reported.A ceiling layer is not designated in the METAR code. For aviation purposes, the ceiling is the lowest broken or overcast layer, or vertical visibility into an obscuration. Also there is no provision for reporting thin layers in the METAR code. When clouds are thin, that layer must be reported as if it were opaque.\n\n\nHeight. Cloud bases are reported with three digits in hundreds of feet above ground level (AGL). (Clouds above 12,000\u2009feet cannot be reported by an automated station).\n\n(Type). If Towering Cumulus Clouds (TCU) or Cumulonimbus Clouds (CB) are present, they are reported after the height which represents their base.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n(Reported as) SCT025TCU BKN080 BKN250 (spoken as) \u201cTWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SCATTERED TOWERING CUMULUS, CEILING EIGHT THOUSAND BROKEN, TWO FIVE THOUSAND BROKEN.\u201d\n(Reported as) SCT008 OVC012CB (spoken as) \u201cEIGHT HUNDRED SCATTERED CEILING ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED OVERCAST CUMULONIMBUS CLOUDS.\u201d\nVertical Visibility (indefinite ceiling height). The height into an indefinite ceiling is preceded by \u201cVV\u201d and followed by three digits indicating the vertical visibility in hundreds of feet. This layer indicates total obscuration.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n1/8 SM FG VV006 - visibility one eighth, fog, indefinite ceiling six hundred.\nObscurations are reported when the sky is partially obscured by a ground-based phenomena by indicating the amount of obscuration as FEW, SCT, BKN followed by three zeros (000). In remarks, the obscuring phenomenon precedes the amount of obscuration and three zeros.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nBKN000 (in body) - \u201csky partially obscured\u201d\nFU BKN000 (in remarks) - \u201csmoke obscuring five- to seven-eighths of the sky\u201d\nWhen sky conditions include a layer aloft, other than clouds, such as smoke or haze the type of phenomena, sky cover and height are shown in remarks.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nBKN020 (in body) - \u201cceiling two thousand broken\u201d\nRMK FU BKN020 - \u201cbroken layer of smoke aloft, based at two thousand\u201d\nVariable ceiling. When a ceiling is below three thousand and is variable, the remark \u201cCIG\u201d will be shown followed with the lowest and highest ceiling heights separated by a \u201cV.\u201d\n\nEXAMPLE-\nCIG 005V010\t - \u201cceiling variable between five hundred and one thousand\u201d\nSecond site sensor. When an automated station uses meteorological discontinuity sensors, remarks will be shown to identify site specific sky conditions which differ and are lower than conditions reported in the body.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nCIG 020 RY11\t - \u201cceiling two thousand at runway one one\u201d\nVariable cloud layer. When a layer is varying in sky cover, remarks will show the variability range. If there is more than one cloud layer, the variable layer will be identified by including the layer height.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nSCT V BKN\t - \u201cscattered layer variable to broken\u201d\nBKN025 V OVC \t - \u201cbroken layer at two thousand  five hundred variable to overcast\u201d\nSignificant clouds. When significant clouds are observed, they are shown in remarks, along with the specified information as shown below:\n\nCumulonimbus (CB), or Cumulonimbus Mammatus (CBMAM), distance (if known), direction from the station, and direction of movement, if known. If the clouds are beyond 10\u2009miles from the airport, DSNT will indicate distance.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nCB W MOV E\t - \u201ccumulonimbus west moving east\u201d\nCBMAM DSNT S\t - \u201ccumulonimbus mammatus distant south\u201d\n\nTowering Cumulus (TCU), location, (if known), or direction from the station.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nTCU OHD\t - \u201ctowering cumulus overhead\u201d\nTCU W\t - \u201ctowering cumulus west\u201d\nAltocumulus Castellanus (ACC), Stratocumulus Standing Lenticular (SCSL), Altocumulus Standing Lenticular (ACSL), Cirrocumulus Standing Lenticular (CCSL) or rotor clouds, describing the clouds (if needed) and the direction from the station.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nACC W\t - \u201caltocumulus castellanus  west\u201d\nACSL SW-S\t - \u201cstanding lenticular altocumulus southwest through south\u201d\nAPRNT ROTOR CLD S - \u201capparent rotor cloud south\u201d\nCCSL OVR MT E\t - \u201cstanding lenticular cirrocumulus over the mountains east\u201d\nTemperature/Dew Point. Temperature and dew point are reported in two, two\u2010digit groups in degrees Celsius, separated by a solidus (\u201c/\u201d). Temperatures below zero are prefixed with an \u201cM.\u201d If the temperature is available but the dew point is missing, the temperature is shown followed by a solidus. If the temperature is missing, the group is omitted from the report.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n15/08 \t - \u201ctemperature one five, dew point 8\u201d\n00/M02 \t - \u201ctemperature zero, dew point minus 2\u201d\nM05/\t - \u201ctemperature minus five, dew point missing\u201d\nAltimeter. Altimeter settings are reported in a four\u2010digit format in inches of mercury prefixed with an \u201cA\u201d to denote the units of pressure.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nA2995 - \u201cAltimeter two niner niner five\u201d\nRemarks. Remarks will be included in all observations, when appropriate. The contraction \u201cRMK\u201d denotes the start of the remarks section of a METAR report.\nExcept for precipitation, phenomena located within 5\u2009statute miles of the point of observation will be reported as at the station. Phenomena between 5 and 10 statute miles will be reported in the vicinity, \u201cVC.\u201d Precipitation not occurring at the point of observation but within 10 statute miles is also reported as in the vicinity, \u201cVC.\u201d Phenomena beyond 10 statute miles will be shown as distant, \u201cDSNT.\u201d Distances are in statute miles except for automated lightning remarks which are in nautical miles. Movement of clouds or weather will be indicated by the direction toward which the phenomena is moving.\nThere are two categories of remarks:\n\nAutomated, manual, and plain language.\n\n\nAdditive and automated maintenance data.\n\n\nAutomated, Manual, and Plain Language. This group of remarks may be generated from either manual or automated weather reporting stations and generally elaborate on parameters reported in the body of the report.

A concise statement of the expected meteorological conditions at an airport during a specified period. At most locations, TAFs have a 24 hour forecast period. However, TAFs for some locations have a 30 hour forecast period. These forecast periods may be shorter in the case of an amended TAF. TAFs use the same codes as METAR weather reports. They are scheduled four times daily for 24-hour periods beginning at 0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, and 1800Z.\nForecast times in the TAF are depicted in two ways. The first is a 6-digit number to indicate a specific point in time, consisting of a two-digit date, two-digit hour, and two-digit minute (such as issuance time or FM). The second is a pair of four-digit numbers separated by a \u201c/\u201d to indicate a beginning and end for a period of time. In this case, each four-digit pair consists of a two-digit date and a two-digit hour.TAFs are issued in the following format:TYPE OF REPORT/ICAO STATION IDENTIFIER/DATE AND TIME OF ORIGIN/VALID PERIOD DATE AND TIME/FORECAST METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS\nNOTE-\nThe \u201c/\u201d above and in the following descriptions are for separation purposes in this publication and do not appear in the actual TAFs.\nTAF KORD 051130Z 0512/0618 14008KT 5SM BR BKN030 \n\tTEMPO 0513/0516 1 1/2SM BR\n\tFM051600 16010KT P6SM SKC\n\tFM052300 20013G20KT 4SM SHRA OVC020\n\tPROB40 0600/0606 2SM TSRA OVC008CB \n\tBECMG 0606/0608 21015KT P6SM NSW SCT040\nTAF format observed in the above example:\nTAF = type of report\nKORD = ICAO station identifier\n051130Z = date and time of origin (issuance time)\n0512/0618 = valid period date and times\n14008KT 5SM BR BKN030 = forecast meteorological conditions\nExplanation of TAF elements:\n\nType of Report. There are two types of TAF issuances, a routine forecast issuance (TAF) and an amended forecast (TAF AMD). An amended TAF is issued when the current TAF no longer adequately describes the on\u2010going weather or the forecaster feels the TAF is not representative of the current or expected weather. Corrected (COR) or delayed (RTD) TAFs are identified only in the communications header which precedes the actual forecasts.\n\n\nICAO Station Identifier. The TAF code uses ICAO 4-letter location identifiers as described in the METAR section.\n\nDate and Time of Origin. This element is the date and time the forecast is actually prepared. The format is a two-digit date and four-digit time followed, without a space, by the letter \u201cZ.\u201d\n\nValid Period Date and Time. The UTC valid period of the forecast consists of two four-digit sets, separated by a \u201c/\u201d. The first four-digit set is a two-digit date followed by the two-digit beginning hour, and the second four-digit set is a two-digit date followed by the two-digit ending hour. Although most airports have a 24-hour TAF, a select number of airports have a 30-hour TAF. In the case of an amended forecast, or a forecast which is corrected or delayed, the valid period may be for less than 24 hours. Where an airport or terminal operates on a part-time basis (less than 24 hours/day), the TAFs issued for those locations will have the abbreviated statement \u201cAMD NOT SKED\u201d added to the end of the forecasts. The time observations are scheduled to end and/or resume will be indicated by expanding the AMD NOT SKED statement. Expanded statements will include:\n\nObservation ending time (AFT DDHHmm; for example, AFT 120200)\n\n\nScheduled observations resumption time (TIL DDHHmm; for example, TIL 171200Z) or\n\nPeriod of observation unavailability (DDHH/DDHH); for example, 2502/2512).\n\nForecast Meteorological Conditions. This is the body of the TAF. The basic format is:\nWIND/VISIBILITY/WEATHER/SKY CONDITION/OPTIONAL DATA (WIND SHEAR)The wind, visibility, and sky condition elements are always included in the initial time group of the forecast. Weather is included only if significant to aviation. If a significant, lasting change in any of the elements is expected during the valid period, a new time period with the changes is included. It should be noted that with the exception of a \u201cFM\u201d group the new time period will include only those elements which are expected to change, i.e., if a lowering of the visibility is expected but the wind is expected to remain the same, the new time period reflecting the lower visibility would not include a forecast wind. The forecast wind would remain the same as in the previous time period. Any temporary conditions expected during a specific time period are included with that time period. The following describes the elements in the above format.\nWind. This five (or six) digit group includes the expected wind direction (first 3 digits) and speed (last 2 digits or 3 digits if 100 knots or greater). The contraction \u201cKT\u201d follows to denote the units of wind speed. Wind gusts are noted by the letter \u201cG\u201d appended to the wind speed followed by the highest expected gust. A variable wind direction is noted by \u201cVRB\u201d where the three digit direction usually appears. A calm wind (3 knots or less) is forecast as \u201c00000KT.\u201d\n\nEXAMPLE-\n18010KT - wind one eight zero at one zero (wind is blowing from 180).\n35012G20KT - wind three five zero at one two gust two zero.\n\nVisibility. The expected prevailing visibility up to and including 6 miles is forecast in statute miles, including fractions of miles, followed by \u201cSM\u201d to note the units of measure. Expected visibilities greater than 6 miles are forecast as P6SM (plus six\u2009statute miles).\n\nEXAMPLE-\n1/2SM - visibility one-half\n4SM - visibility four\nP6SM - visibility more than six\nWeather Phenomena. The expected weather phenomena is coded in TAF reports using the same format, qualifiers, and phenomena contractions as METAR reports (except UP). Obscurations to vision will be forecast whenever the prevailing visibility is forecast to be 6 statute miles or less. If no significant weather is expected to occur during a specific time period in the forecast, the weather phenomena group is omitted for that time period. If, after a time period in which significant weather phenomena has been forecast, a change to a forecast of no significant weather phenomena occurs, the contraction NSW (No Significant Weather) will appear as the weather group in the new time period. (NSW is included only in TEMPO groups).\n\nNOTE-\nIt is very important that pilots understand that NSW only refers to weather phenomena, i.e., rain, snow, drizzle, etc. Omitted conditions, such as sky conditions, visibility, winds, etc., are carried over from the previous time group.\n\nSky Condition. TAF sky condition forecasts use the METAR format described in the METAR section. Cumulonimbus clouds (CB) are the only cloud type forecast in TAFs. When clear skies are forecast, the contraction \u201cSKC\u201d will always be used. The contraction \u201cCLR\u201d is never used in the TAF. When the sky is obscured due to a surface-based phenomenon, vertical visibility (VV) into the obscuration is forecast. The format for vertical visibility is \u201cVV\u201d followed by a three-digit height in hundreds of feet.\n\nNOTE-\nAs in METAR, ceiling layers are not designated in the TAF code. For aviation purposes, the ceiling is the lowest broken or overcast layer or vertical visibility into a complete obscuration.\nSKC\u201csky clear\u201dSCT005 BKN025CB\u201cfive hundred scattered, ceiling two thousand five hundred broken cumulonimbus  clouds\u201dVV008\u201cindefinite ceiling eight hundred\u201d\nOptional Data (Wind Shear). Wind shear is the forecast of nonconvective low level winds (up to 2,000 feet). The forecast includes the letters \u201cWS\u201d followed by the height of the wind shear, the wind direction and wind speed at the indicated height and the ending letters \u201cKT\u201d (knots). Height is given in hundreds of feet (AGL) up to and including 2,000\u2009feet. Wind shear is encoded with the contraction \u201cWS,\u201d followed by a three-digit height, slant character \u201c/,\u201d and winds at the height indicated in the same format as surface winds. The wind shear element is omitted if not expected to occur.\nWS010/18040KT - \u201cLOW LEVEL WIND SHEAR AT ONE THOUSAND, WIND ONE EIGHT ZERO AT FOUR ZERO\u201d\nProbability Forecast. The probability or chance of thunderstorms or other precipitation events occurring, along with associated weather conditions (wind, visibility, and sky conditions). The PROB30 group is used when the occurrence of thunderstorms or precipitation is 30-39% and the PROB40 group is used when the occurrence of thunderstorms or precipitation is 40-49%. This is followed by two four-digit groups separated by a \u201c/\u201d, giving the beginning date and hour, and the ending date and hour of the time period during which the thunderstorms or precipitation are expected.\n\nNOTE-\nNWS does not use PROB 40 in the TAF. However U.S. Military generated TAFS may include PROB40. PROB30 will not be shown during the first nine hours of a NWS forecast.\n\nEXAMPLE-PROB40 2221/2302 1/2SM +TSRA\u201cchance between 2100Z and 0200Z of visibility one-half statute mile in thunderstorms and heavy rain.\u201d PROB30 3010/3014 1SM RASN\u201cchance between 1000Z and 1400Z of visibility one statute mile in mixed rain and snow.\u201d\nForecast Change Indicators. The following change indicators are used when either a rapid, gradual, or temporary change is expected in some or all of the forecast meteorological conditions. Each change indicator marks a time group within the TAF report.\n\nFrom (FM) group. The FM group is used when a rapid change, usually occurring in less than one hour, in prevailing conditions is expected. Typically, a rapid change of prevailing conditions to more or less a completely new set of prevailing conditions is associated with a synoptic feature passing through the terminal area (cold or warm frontal passage). Appended to the \u201cFM\u201d indicator is the six-digit date, hour, and minute the change is expected to begin and continues until the next change group or until the end of the current forecast. A \u201cFM\u201d group will mark the beginning of a new line in a TAF report (indented 5 spaces). Each \u201cFM\u201d group contains all the required elements-wind, visibility, weather, and sky condition. Weather will be omitted in \u201cFM\u201d groups when it is not significant to aviation. FM groups will not include the contraction NSW.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nFM210100 14010KT P6SM SKC - \u201cafter 0100Z on the 21st, wind one four zero at one zero, visibility more than six, sky clear.\u201d\n\nBecoming (BECMG) group. The BECMG group is used when a gradual change in conditions is expected over a longer time period, usually two hours.

Both the PDC and CPDLC-DCL functions automate the Clearance Delivery operations in the ATCT for participating users. Both functions display IFR clearances from the ARTCC to the ATCT. The Clearance Delivery controller in the ATCT can append local departure information and transmit the clearance via data link to participating airline/service provider computers for PDC. The airline/service provider will then deliver the clearance via the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) or a similar data link system, or for non-data link equipped aircraft, via a printer located at the departure gate. For CPDLC-DCL, the departure clearance is uplinked from the ATCT via the Future Air Navigation System (FANS) to the aircraft avionics and requires a response from the flight crew. Both PDC and CPDLC-DCL reduce frequency congestion, controller workload, and are intended to mitigate delivery/read back errors.\n\n\nBoth services are available only to participating aircraft that have subscribed to the service through an approved service provider.\n\nIn all situations, the pilot is encouraged to contact clearance delivery if a question or concern exists regarding an automated clearance.

The ATC instruction \u201cLINE UP AND WAIT\u201d is used to instruct a pilot to taxi onto the departure runway and line up and wait.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nTower: \u201cN234AR Runway 24L, line up and wait.\u201d\n\nThis ATC instruction is not an authorization to takeoff. In instances where the pilot has been instructed to line up and wait and has been advised of a reason/condition (wake turbulence, traffic on an intersecting runway, etc.) or the reason/condition is clearly visible (another aircraft that has landed on or is taking off on the same runway), and the reason/condition is satisfied, the pilot should expect an imminent takeoff clearance, unless advised of a delay. If you are uncertain about any ATC instruction or clearance, contact ATC immediately.\n\nIf a takeoff clearance is not received within a reasonable amount of time after clearance to line up and wait, ATC should be contacted.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nAircraft: Cessna 234AR holding in position Runway 24L.\nAircraft: Cessna 234AR holding in position Runway 24L at Bravo.\nNOTE-\nFAA analysis of accidents and incidents involving aircraft holding in position indicate that two minutes or more elapsed between the time the instruction was issued to line up and wait and the resulting event (for example, land-over or go-around). Pilots should consider the length of time that they have been holding in position whenever they HAVE NOT been advised of any expected delay to determine when it is appropriate to query the controller.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAdvisory Circulars 91-73A, Part 91 and Part 135 Single-Pilot Procedures during Taxi Operations, and 120-74A, Parts 91, 121, 125, and 135 Flightcrew Procedures during Taxi Operations.\n\n\nSituational awareness during line up and wait operations is enhanced by monitoring ATC instructions/clearances issued to other aircraft. Pilots should listen carefully if another aircraft is on frequency that has a similar call sign and pay close attention to communications between ATC and other aircraft. If you are uncertain of an ATC instruction or clearance, query ATC immediately. Care should be taken to not inadvertently execute a clearance/instruction for another aircraft.\n\nPilots should be especially vigilant when conducting line up and wait operations at night or during reduced visibility conditions. They should scan the full length of the runway and look for aircraft on final approach or landing roll out when taxiing onto a runway. ATC should be contacted anytime there is a concern about a potential conflict.\n\nWhen two or more runways are active, aircraft may be instructed to \u201cLINE UP AND WAIT\u201d on two or more runways. When multiple runway operations are being conducted, it is important to listen closely for your call sign and runway. Be alert for similar sounding call signs and acknowledge all instructions with your call sign. When you are holding in position and are not sure if the takeoff clearance was for you, ask ATC before you begin takeoff roll. ATC prefers that you confirm a takeoff clearance rather than mistake another aircraft's clearance for your own.\n\nWhen ATC issues intersection \u201cline up and wait\u201d and takeoff clearances, the intersection designator will be used. If ATC omits the intersection designator, call ATC for clarification.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nAircraft: \u201cCherokee 234AR, Runway 24L at November 4, line up and wait.\u201d\nIf landing traffic is a factor during line up and wait operations, ATC will inform the aircraft in position of the closest traffic within 6 flying miles requesting a full-stop, touch-and-go, stop-and-go, or an unrestricted low approach to the same runway. Pilots should take care to note the position of landing traffic. ATC will also advise the landing traffic when an aircraft is authorized to \u201cline up and wait\u201d on the same runway.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nTower: \u201cCessna 234AR, Runway 24L, line up and wait. Traffic a Boeing 737, six mile final.\u201d\nTower: \u201cDelta 1011, continue, traffic a Cessna 210 holding in position Runway 24L.\u201d\nNOTE-\nATC will normally withhold landing clearance to arrival aircraft when another aircraft is in position and holding on the runway.\n\nNever land on a runway that is occupied by another aircraft, even if a landing clearance was issued. Do not hesitate to ask the controller about the traffic on the runway and be prepared to execute a go-around.\n\nNOTE-\nAlways clarify any misunderstanding or confusion concerning ATC instructions or clearances. ATC should be advised immediately if there is any uncertainty about the ability to comply with any of their instructions."

A pilot may receive a clearance, when operating from an airport without a control tower, which contains a provision for the clearance to be void if not airborne by a specific time. A pilot who does not depart prior to the clearance void time must advise ATC as soon as possible of their intentions. ATC will normally advise the pilot of the time allotted to notify ATC that the aircraft did not depart prior to the clearance void time. This time cannot exceed 30 minutes. Failure of an aircraft to contact ATC within 30 minutes after the clearance void time will result in the aircraft being considered overdue and search and rescue procedures initiated.\n\nNOTE-\nOther IFR traffic for the airport where the clearance is issued is suspended until the aircraft has contacted ATC or until 30 minutes after the clearance void time or 30 minutes after the clearance release time if no clearance void time is issued.If the clearance void time expires, it does not cancel the departure clearance or IFR flight plan. It withdraws the pilot's authority to depart IFR until a new departure release/release time has been issued by ATC and is acknowledged by the pilot.Pilots who depart at or after their clearance void time are not afforded IFR separation and may be in violation of 14\u2009CFR Section 91.173 which requires that pilots receive an appropriate ATC clearance before operating IFR in controlled airspace.Pilots who choose to depart VFR after their clearance void time has expired should not depart using the previously assigned IFR transponder code.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nClearance void if not off by (clearance void time) and, if required, if not off by (clearance void time) advise (facility) not later than (time) of intentions.\n\nHold for Release. ATC may issue \u201chold for release\u201d instructions in a clearance to delay an aircraft's departure for traffic management reasons (i.e., weather, traffic volume, etc.). When ATC states in the clearance, \u201chold for release,\u201d the pilot may not depart utilizing that IFR clearance until a release time or additional instructions are issued by ATC. In addition, ATC will include departure delay information in conjunction with \u201chold for release\u201d instructions. The ATC instruction, \u201chold for release,\u201d applies to the IFR clearance and does not prevent the pilot from departing under VFR. However, prior to takeoff the pilot should cancel the IFR flight plan and operate the transponder/ADS-B on the appropriate VFR code. An IFR clearance may not be available after departure.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n(Aircraft identification) cleared to (destination) airport as filed, maintain (altitude), and, if required (additional instructions or information), hold for release, expect (time in hours and/or minutes) departure delay.\nRelease Times. A \u201crelease time\u201d is a departure restriction issued to a pilot by ATC, specifying the earliest time an aircraft may depart. ATC will use \u201crelease times\u201d in conjunction with traffic management procedures and/or to separate a departing aircraft from other traffic.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n(Aircraft identification) released for departure at (time in hours and/or minutes).\nExpect Departure Clearance Time (EDCT). The EDCT is the runway release time assigned to an aircraft included in traffic management programs. Aircraft are expected to depart no earlier than 5\u2009minutes before, and no later than 5 minutes after the EDCT.\n\n\nIf practical, pilots departing uncontrolled airports should obtain IFR clearances prior to becoming airborne when two\u2010way communications with the controlling ATC facility is available."

                "section-content": "Departure Control is an approach control function responsible for ensuring separation between departures. So as to expedite the handling of departures, Departure Control may suggest a takeoff direction other than that which may normally have been used under VFR handling. Many times it is preferred to offer the pilot a runway that will require the fewest turns after takeoff to place the pilot on course or selected departure route as quickly as possible. At many locations particular attention is paid to the use of preferential runways for local noise abatement programs, and route departures away from congested areas.\n\n\nDeparture Control utilizing radar will normally clear aircraft out of the terminal area using vectors, a diverse vector area (DVA), or published DPs.\n\nWhen a departure is to be vectored immediately following takeoff using vectors, a DVA, or published DPs that begins with an ATC assigned heading off the ground, the pilot will be advised prior to takeoff of the initial heading to be flown but may not be advised of the purpose of the heading. When ATC assigns an initial heading with the takeoff clearance that will take the aircraft off an assigned procedure (for example, an RNAV SID with a published lateral path to a waypoint and crossing restrictions from the departure end of runway), the controller will assign an altitude to maintain with the initial heading and, if necessary, a speed to maintain.\n\n\nAt some airports when a departure will fly an RNAV SID that begins at the runway, ATC may advise aircraft of the initial fix/waypoint on the RNAV route. The purpose of the advisory is to remind pilots to verify the correct procedure is programmed in the FMS before takeoff. Pilots must immediately advise ATC if a different RNAV SID is entered in the aircraft's FMC. When this advisory is absent, pilots are still required to fly the assigned SID as published.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nDelta 345 RNAV to MPASS, Runway26L, cleared for takeoff.\nNOTE-\nThe SID transition is not restated as it is contained in the ATC clearance.Aircraft cleared via RNAV SIDs designed to begin with a vector to the initial waypoint are assigned a heading before departure.\n\nPilots operating in a radar environment are expected to associate departure headings or an RNAV departure advisory with vectors or the flight path to their planned route or flight. When given a vector taking the aircraft off a previously assigned nonradar route, the pilot will be advised briefly what the vector is to achieve. Thereafter, radar service will be provided until the aircraft has been reestablished \u201con\u2010course\u201d using an appropriate navigation aid and the pilot has been advised of the aircraft's position or a handoff is made to another radar controller with further surveillance capabilities.\n\nControllers will inform pilots of the departure control frequencies and, if appropriate, the transponder code before takeoff. Pilots must ensure their transponder/ADS-B is adjusted to the \u201con\u201d or normal operating position as soon as practical and remain on during all operations unless otherwise requested to change to \u201cstandby\u201d by ATC. Pilots should not change to the departure control frequency until requested.

                "section-content": "Instrument departure procedures are preplanned instrument flight rule (IFR) procedures which provide obstruction clearance from the terminal area to the appropriate en route structure. There are two\u2009types of DPs, Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP), printed either textually or graphically, and Standard Instrument Departures (SID), always printed graphically. All DPs, either textual or graphic may be designed using either conventional or RNAV criteria. RNAV procedures will have RNAV printed in the title; for example,\u2009SHEAD TWO DEPARTURE (RNAV). ODPs provide obstruction clearance via the least onerous route from the terminal area to the appropriate en route structure. ODPs are recommended for obstruction clearance and may be flown without ATC clearance unless an alternate departure procedure (SID or radar vector) has been specifically assigned by ATC. Graphic ODPs will have (OBSTACLE) printed in the procedure title; for example,\u2009GEYSR THREE DEPARTURE (OBSTACLE), or, CROWN ONE DEPARTURE (RNAV) (OBSTACLE). Standard Instrument Departures are air traffic control (ATC) procedures printed for pilot/controller use in graphic form to provide obstruction clearance and a transition from the terminal area to the appropriate en route structure. SIDs are primarily designed for system enhancement and to reduce pilot/controller workload. ATC clearance must be received prior to flying a SID. All DPs provide the pilot with a way to depart the airport and transition to the en route structure safely.\n\n\nA Diverse Vector Area (DVA) is an area in which ATC may provide random radar vectors during an uninterrupted climb from the departure runway until above the MVA/MIA, established in accordance with the TERPS criteria for diverse departures. The DVA provides obstacle and terrain  avoidance in lieu of taking off from the runway under IFR using an ODP or SID.\n\nPilots operating under 14\u2009CFR Part 91 are strongly encouraged to file and fly a DP at night, during marginal Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) and Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), when one is available. The following paragraphs will provide an overview of the DP program, why DPs are developed, what criteria are used, where to find them, how they are to be flown, and finally pilot and ATC responsibilities.\n\nWhy are DPs necessary? The primary reason is to provide obstacle clearance protection information to pilots. A secondary reason, at busier airports, is to increase efficiency and reduce communications and departure delays through the use of SIDs. When an instrument approach is initially developed for an airport, the need for DPs is assessed. The procedure designer conducts an obstacle analysis to support departure operations. If an aircraft may turn in any direction from a runway within the limits of the assessment area (see paragraph 5-2-9e3) and remain clear of obstacles, that runway passes what is called a diverse departure assessment and no ODP will be published. A SID may be published if needed for air traffic control purposes. However, if an obstacle penetrates what is called the 40:1 obstacle identification surface, then the procedure designer chooses whether to:\n\nEstablish a steeper than normal climb gradient; or\n\n\nEstablish a steeper than normal climb gradient with an alternative that increases takeoff minima to allow the pilot to visually remain clear of the obstacle(s); or\n\nDesign and publish a specific departure route; or\n\nA combination or all of the above.\n\nWhat criteria is used to provide obstruction clearance during departure?\n\nUnless specified otherwise, required obstacle clearance for all departures, including diverse, is based on the pilot crossing the departure end of the runway at least 35 feet above the departure end of runway elevation, climbing to 400 feet above the departure end of runway elevation before making the initial turn, and maintaining a minimum climb gradient of 200 feet per nautical mile (FPNM), unless required to level off by a crossing restriction, until the minimum IFR altitude. A greater climb gradient may be specified in the DP to clear obstacles or to achieve an ATC crossing restriction. If an initial turn higher than 400 feet above the departure end of runway elevation is specified in the DP, the turn should be commenced at the higher altitude. If a turn is specified at a fix, the turn must be made at that fix. Fixes may have minimum and/or maximum crossing altitudes that must be adhered to prior to passing the fix. In rare instances, obstacles that exist on the extended runway centerline may make an \u201cearly turn\u201d more desirable than proceeding straight ahead. In these cases, the published departure instructions will include the language \u201cturn left(right) as soon as practicable.\u201d These departures will also include a ceiling and visibility minimum of at least 300 and 1. Pilots encountering one of these DPs should preplan the climb out to gain altitude and begin the turn as quickly as possible within the bounds of safe operating practices and operating limitations. This type of departure procedure is being phased out.\n\nNOTE-\n\u201cPractical\u201d or \u201cfeasible\u201d may exist in some existing departure text instead of \u201cpracticable.\u201d\n\n\nODPs, SIDs, and DVAs assume normal aircraft performance, and that all engines are operating. Development of contingency procedures, required to\u2009cover the case of an engine failure or other emergency in flight that may occur after liftoff, is the\u2009responsibility of the operator. (More detailed information on this subject is available in Advisory Circular AC 120-91, Airport Obstacle Analysis, and in the \u201cDeparture Procedures\u201d section of chapter 2 in the Instrument Procedures Handbook, FAA-H-8083-16.)\n\nThe 40:1 obstacle identification surface (OIS) begins at the departure end of runway (DER) and slopes upward at 152 FPNM until reaching the minimum IFR altitude or entering the en route structure. This assessment area is limited to 25 NM from the airport in nonmountainous areas and 46 NM in designated mountainous areas. Beyond this distance, the pilot is responsible for obstacle clearance if not operating on a published route, if below (having not reached) the MEA or MOCA of a published route, or an ATC assigned altitude. See FIG 5-2-1. (Ref 14 CFR 91.177 for further information on en route altitudes.)\n\nNOTE-\nODPs are normally designed to terminate within these distance limitations, however, some ODPs will contain routes that may exceed 25/46 NM; these routes will ensure obstacle protection until reaching the end of the ODP.\n\nObstacles that are located within 1 NM of the DER and penetrate the 40:1 OCS are referred to as \u201clow, close-in obstacles.\u201d The standard required obstacle clearance (ROC) of 48 feet per NM to clear these obstacles would require a climb gradient greater than 200 feet per NM for a very short distance, only until the aircraft was 200 feet above the DER. To eliminate publishing an excessive climb gradient, the obstacle AGL/MSL height and location relative to the DER is noted in the \u201cTake-off Minimums and (OBSTACLE) Departure Procedures\u201d section of a given Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP) booklet.\n\nPilots must refer to the TPP booklet  or the Graphic ODP for information on these obstacles. These obstacle notes will no longer be published on SIDs. Pilots assigned a SID for departure must refer to the airport entry in the TPP to obtain information on these obstacles.\n\n\nThe purpose of noting obstacles in the \u201cTake-off Minimums and (OBSTACLE) Departure Procedures\u201d section of the TPP is to identify the obstacle(s) and alert the pilot to the height and location of the obstacle(s) so they can be avoided. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways; for example, the pilot may be able to see the obstruction and maneuver around the obstacle(s) if necessary; early liftoff/climb performance may allow the aircraft\u2009to cross well above the obstacle(s); or if the obstacle(s) cannot be visually acquired during departure, preflight planning should take into account what turns or other maneuvers may be necessary immediately after takeoff to avoid the obstruction(s).\nFIG 5-2-1Diverse Departure Obstacle Assessment to 25/46 NM\n\nEXAMPLE-\nTAKEOFF OBSTACLE NOTES: Rwy 14, trees 2011' from DER, 29' left of centerline, 100' AGL/3829' MSL. Rwy 32, trees 1009' from DER, 697' left of centerline, 100' AGL/3839' MSL. Tower 4448' from DER, 1036' left of centerline, 165' AGL/3886' MSL.\nNOTE-\nCompliance with 14 CFR Part 121 or 135 one-engine-inoperative (OEI) departure performance requirements, or similar ICAO/State rules, cannot be assured by the sole use of \u201clow, close-in\" obstacle data as published in the TPP. Operators should refer to precise data sources (for example, GIS database, etc.) specifically intended for OEI departure planning for those operations.\n\nClimb gradients greater than 200 FPNM are specified when required to support procedure design constraints, obstacle clearance, and/or airspace restrictions. Compliance with a climb gradient for these purposes is mandatory when the procedure is part of the ATC clearance, unless increased takeoff minimums are provided and weather conditions allow compliance with these minimums.\n\nNOTE-\nClimb gradients for ATC purposes are being phased out on SIDs.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cCross ALPHA intersection at or below 4000; maintain 6000.\u201d The pilot climbs at least 200 FPNM to 6000. If 4000 is reached before ALPHA, the pilot levels off at 4000 until passing ALPHA; then immediately resumes at least 200 FPNM climb.\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cTAKEOFF MINIMUMS:  RWY 27, Standard with a minimum climb of 280' per NM to 2500.\u201d A climb of at least 280 FPNM is required to 2500 and is mandatory when the departure procedure is included in the ATC clearance.\nNOTE-\nSome SIDs still retain labeled \u201cATC\u201d climb gradients published or have climb gradients that are established to meet a published  altitude restriction that is not required for obstacle clearance or  procedure design criteria. These procedures will be revised in the course of the normal procedure amendment process.\n\nClimb gradients may be specified only to an altitude/fix, above which the normal gradient applies.\nAn ATC-required altitude restriction published at a fix, will not have an associated climb gradient published with that restriction. Pilots are expected to determine if crossing altitudes can be met, based on the performance capability of the aircraft they are operating.\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cMinimum climb 340 FPNM to ALPHA.\u201d The pilot climbs at least 340 FPNM to ALPHA, then at least 200 FPNM to MIA.\nA Visual Climb Over Airport (VCOA) procedure is a departure option for an IFR aircraft, operating in visual meteorological conditions equal to or greater than the specified visibility and ceiling, to visually conduct climbing turns over the airport to the published \u201cat or above\u201d altitude. At this point, the pilot may proceed in instrument meteorological conditions to the first en route fix using a diverse departure, or to proceed via a published routing to a fix from where the aircraft may join the IFR en route structure, while maintaining a climb gradient of at least 200 feet per nautical mile. VCOA procedures are developed to avoid obstacles greater than 3 statute miles from the departure end of the runway as an alternative to complying with climb gradients greater than 200 feet per nautical mile. Pilots are responsible to advise ATC as early as possible of the intent to fly the VCOA option prior to departure. Pilots are expected to remain within the distance prescribed in the published visibility minimums during the climb over the airport until reaching the \u201cat or above\u201d altitude for the VCOA procedure.  If no additional routing is published, then the pilot may proceed in accordance with their IFR clearance. If additional routing is published after the \u201cat-or-above\u201d altitude, the pilot must comply with the route to a fix that may include a climb-in-holding pattern to reach the MEA/MIA for the en route portion of their IFR flight. These textual procedures are published in the Take-Off Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure Procedures section of the Terminal Procedures Publications and/or appear as an option on a Graphic ODP.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nTAKEOFF MINIMUMS: Rwy 32, standard with minimum climb of 410' per NM to 3000' or 1100-3 for VCOA. \nVCOA: Rwy 32, obtain ATC approval for VCOA when requesting IFR clearance. Climb in visual conditions to cross Broken Bow Muni/Keith Glaze Field at or above 3500' before proceeding on course.\nWho is responsible for obstacle clearance? DPs are designed so that adherence to the procedure by the pilot will ensure obstacle protection. Additionally:\n\nObstacle clearance responsibility also rests with the pilot when he/she chooses to climb in visual conditions in lieu of flying a DP and/or depart under increased takeoff minima rather than fly the climb gradient. Standard takeoff minima are one statute mile for aircraft having two engines or less and one-half statute mile for aircraft having more than two engines. Specified ceiling and visibility minima will allow visual avoidance of obstacles during the initial climb at the standard climb gradient. When departing using the VCOA, obstacle avoidance is not guaranteed if the pilot maneuvers farther from the airport than the published visibility minimum for the VCOA prior to reaching the published VCOA altitude. DPs may also contain what are called Low Close in Obstacles. These obstacles are less than 200 feet above the departure end of runway elevation and within one NM of the runway end and do not require increased takeoff minimums. These obstacles are identified on the SID chart or in the Take-off Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure Procedures section of the U. S. Terminal Procedure booklet. These obstacles are especially critical to aircraft that do not lift off until close to the departure end of the runway or which climb at the minimum rate. Pilots should also consider drift following lift-off to ensure sufficient clearance from these obstacles. That segment of the procedure that requires the pilot to see and avoid obstacles ends when the aircraft crosses the specified point at the required altitude. In all cases continued obstacle clearance is based on having climbed a minimum of 200 feet per nautical mile to the specified point and then continuing to climb at least 200 foot per nautical mile during the departure until reaching the minimum en route altitude unless specified otherwise.\n\n\nATC may vector the aircraft beginning with an ATC-assigned heading issued with the initial or takeoff clearance followed by subsequent vectors, if required, until reaching the minimum vectoring altitude by using a published Diverse Vector Area (DVA).\n\nThe DVA may be established below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) or Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) in a radar environment at the request of Air Traffic. This type of DP meets the TERPS criteria for diverse departures, obstacles, and terrain avoidance in which vectors below the MVA/MIA may be issued to departing aircraft. The DVA has been assessed for departures which do not follow a specific ground track, but will remain within the specified area. Use of a DVA is valid only when aircraft are permitted to climb uninterrupted from the departure runway to the MVA/MIA (or higher). ATC will not assign an altitude below the MVA/MIA within a DVA. At locations that have a DVA, ATC is not permitted to utilize a SID and DVA concurrently.\n\nThe existence of a DVA will be noted in the Takeoff Minimums and Obstacle Departure Procedure section of the U.S. Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP). The Takeoff Departure procedure will be listed first, followed by any applicable DVA.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nDIVERSE VECTOR AREA (RADAR VECTORS)\nAMDT 1 14289 (FAA)\nRwy 6R, headings as assigned by ATC; requires minimum climb of 290' per NM to 400. \nRwys 6L, 7L, 7R, 24R, 25R, headings as assigned by ATC.\n\nPilots should be aware that a published climb gradient greater than the standard 200\u2009FPNM can exist within a DVA. Pilots should note that the DVA has been assessed for departures which do not follow a specific ground track.\n\nATC may also vector an aircraft off a previously assigned DP. If the aircraft is airborne and established on a SID or ODP and subsequently vectored off, ATC is responsible for terrain and obstruction clearance. In all cases, the minimum 200 FPNM climb gradient is assumed.\n\nNOTE-\nAs is always the case, when used by the controller during departure, the term \u201cradar contact\u201d should not be interpreted as relieving pilots of their responsibility to maintain appropriate terrain and obstruction clearance, which may include flying the obstacle DP.\n\nPilots must preplan to determine if the aircraft can meet the climb gradient (expressed in feet per nautical mile) required by the departure procedure or DVA, and be aware that flying at a higher than anticipated ground speed increases the climb rate requirement in feet per minute. Higher than standard climb gradients are specified by a note on the departure procedure chart for graphic DPs, or in the Take-Off Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure Procedures section of the U.S. Terminal Procedures booklet for textual ODPs. The required climb gradient, or higher, must be maintained to the specified altitude or fix, then the standard climb gradient of 200 ft/NM can be resumed. A table for the conversion of climb gradient (feet per nautical mile) to climb rate (feet per minute), at a given ground speed, is included on the inside of the back cover of the U.S. Terminal Procedures booklets.\n\nWhere are DPs located? DPs and DVAs will be listed by airport in the IFR Takeoff Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure Procedures Section, Section L, of the Terminal Procedures Publications (TPP). If the DP is textual, it will be described in TPP Section L. SIDs and complex ODPs will be published graphically and named. The name will be listed by airport name and runway in Section L. Graphic ODPs will also have the term \u201c(OBSTACLE)\u201d printed in the charted procedure title, differentiating them from SIDs. \n\nAn ODP that has been developed solely for obstacle avoidance will be indicated with the symbol \u201cT\u201d on appropriate Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP) charts and DP charts for that airport. The \u201cT\u201d symbol will continue to refer users to TPP Section C. In the case of a graphic ODP, the TPP Section C will only contain the name of the ODP. Since there may be both a textual and a graphic DP, Section C should still be checked for additional information. The nonstandard takeoff minimums and minimum climb gradients found in TPP Section C also apply to charted DPs and radar vector departures unless different minimums are specified on the charted DP. Takeoff minimums and departure procedures apply to all runways unless otherwise specified. New graphic DPs will have all the information printed on the graphic depiction. As a general rule, ATC will only assign an ODP from a non-towered airport when compliance with the ODP is necessary for aircraft to aircraft separation. Pilots may use the ODP to help ensure separation from terrain and obstacles.\n\n\nResponsibilities\n\nEach pilot, prior to departing an airport on an IFR flight should:\n\nConsider the type of terrain and other obstacles on or in the vicinity of the departure airport;\n\n\nDetermine whether an ODP is available;\n\nDetermine if obstacle avoidance can be maintained visually or if the ODP should be flown; and\n\nConsider the effect of degraded climb performance and the actions to take in the event of an engine loss during the departure. Pilots should notify ATC as soon as possible of reduced climb capability in that circumstance.\n\nNOTE-\nGuidance concerning contingency procedures that address an engine failure on takeoff after V1 speed on a large or turbine-powered transport category airplane may be found in AC 120-91, Airport Obstacle Analysis.\n\nDetermine if a DVA is published and whether the aircraft is capable of meeting the published climb gradient. Advise ATC when requesting the IFR clearance, or as soon as possible, if  unable to meet the DVA climb gradient.\n\nCheck for Takeoff Obstacle Notes published in the TPP for the takeoff runway.\n\n\nPilots should not exceed a published speed restriction associated with a SID waypoint until passing that waypoint.\n\nAfter an aircraft is established on a SID and subsequently vectored or cleared to deviate off of the SID or SID transition, pilots must consider the SID canceled, unless the controller adds \u201cexpect to resume SID;\u201d pilots should then be prepared to rejoin the SID at a subsequent fix or procedure leg. If the SID contains published altitude and/or speed restrictions, those restrictions are canceled and pilots will receive an altitude to maintain and, if necessary, a speed. ATC may also interrupt the vertical navigation of a SID and provide alternate altitude instructions while the aircraft remains established on the published lateral path. Aircraft may be vectored off of an ODP, or issued an altitude lower than a published altitude on an ODP, at which time the ODP is canceled. In these cases, ATC assumes responsibility for terrain and obstacle clearance. In all cases, the minimum 200 FPNM climb gradient is assumed.\n\nAircraft instructed to resume a SID procedure such as a DP or SID which contains speed and/or altitude restrictions, must be:\n\nIssued/reissued all applicable restrictions, or\n\n\nAdvised to \u201cClimb via SID\u201d or resume published speed.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cResume the Solar One departure, Climb via SID.\u201d\n\u201cProceed direct CIROS, resume the Solar One departure, Climb via SID.\u201d\nA clearance for a SID which does not contain published crossing restrictions, and/or is a SID with a Radar Vector segment or a Radar Vector SID, will be issued using the phraseology \u201cMaintain (altitude).\u201d\n\nA clearance for a SID which contains published altitude restrictions may be issued using the phraseology \u201cclimb via.\u201d Climb via is an abbreviated clearance that requires compliance with the procedure lateral path, associated speed and altitude restrictions along the cleared route or procedure. Clearance to \u201cclimb via\u201d authorizes the pilot to:\n\nWhen used in the IFR departure clearance, in a PDC, DCL or when cleared to a waypoint depicted on a SID, to join the procedure after departure or to resume the procedure.\n\n\nWhen vertical navigation is interrupted and an altitude is assigned to maintain which is not contained on the published procedure, to climb from that previously-assigned altitude at pilot's discretion to the altitude depicted for the next waypoint.\n\nOnce established on the depicted departure, to navigate laterally and climb to meet all published or assigned altitude and speed restrictions.\n\nNOTE-\nWhen otherwise cleared along a route or procedure that contains published speed restrictions, the pilot must comply with those speed restrictions independent of a climb via clearance.ATC anticipates pilots will begin adjusting speed the minimum distance necessary prior to a published speed restriction so as to cross the waypoint/fix at the published speed. Once at the published speed ATC expects pilots will maintain the published speed until additional adjustment is required to comply with further published or ATC assigned speed restrictions or as required to ensure compliance with 14 CFR Section 91.117.If ATC interrupts lateral/vertical navigation while an aircraft is flying a SID, ATC must ensure obstacle clearance. When issuing a \u201cclimb via\u201d clearance to join or resume a procedure ATC must ensure obstacle clearance until the aircraft is established on the lateral and vertical path of the SID.ATC will assign an altitude to cross if no altitude is depicted at a waypoint/fix or when otherwise necessary/ required, for an aircraft on a direct route to a waypoint/fix where the SID will be joined or resumed.SIDs will have a \u201ctop altitude;\u201d the \u201ctop altitude\u201d is the charted \u201cmaintain\u201d altitude contained in the procedure description or assigned by ATC.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 5-6-2, Methods.\nPCG, Climb Via, Top Altitude.\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE-Lateral route clearance:\u201cCleared Loop Six departure.\u201d\nNOTE-The aircraft must comply with the SID lateral path, and any published speed restrictions.\nRouting with assigned altitude:\u201cCleared Loop Six departure, climb and maintain four thousand.\u201d\nNOTE-The aircraft must comply with the SID lateral path, and any published speed restriction while climbing unrestricted to four thousand.\n(A pilot filed a flight plan to the Johnston Airport using the Scott One departure, Jonez transition, then Q-145. The pilot filed for FL350. The Scott One includes altitude restrictions, a top altitude and instructions to expect the filed altitude ten minutes after departure).

The clearance will be:\n\t\u201cClimb via SID.\u201d\nNOTE-In Example 6, the aircraft will track laterally and vertically on the Teddd One departure and initially climb to 10,000; Once re-issued the \u201cclimb via\u201d clearance the interim altitude is canceled aircraft will continue climb to FL230 while complying with published restrictions.\n(An aircraft was issued the Bbear Two departure, \u201cclimb via SID\u201d in the IFR departure clearance. An interim altitude of 16,000 was issued instead of the published top altitude of FL 190). After departure, ATC is able to issue a top altitude of FL300 and still requires compliance with the published SID restrictions. The clearance will be: \u201cClimb via SID except maintain flight level three zero zero.\u201d\nNOTE-In Example 7, the aircraft will track laterally and vertically on the Bbear Two departure and initially climb to 16,000; Once re-issued the \u201cclimb via\u201d clearance the interim altitude is canceled and the aircraft will continue climb to FL300 while complying with published restrictions.\n(An aircraft was issued the Bizee Two departure, \u201cclimb via SID.\u201d After departure, ATC vectors the aircraft off of the SID, and then issues a direct routing to rejoin the SID at Rockr waypoint which does not have a published altitude restriction. ATC wants the aircraft to cross at or above 10,000). The clearance will read:\u201cProceed direct Rockr, cross Rockr at or above one-zero thousand, climb via the Bizee Two departure.\u201d\nNOTE-In Example 8, the aircraft will join the Bizee Two SID at Rockr at or above 10,000 and then comply with the published lateral path and any published speed or altitude restrictions while climbing to the SID top altitude.\n(An aircraft was issued the Suzan Two departure, \u201cclimb via SID\u201d in the IFR departure clearance. After departure ATC vectors the aircraft off of the SID, and then clears the aircraft to rejoin the SID at Dvine waypoint, which has a published crossing restriction). The clearance will read:\n \u201cProceed direct Dvine, Climb via the Suzan Two departure.\u201d\nNOTE-In Example 9, the aircraft will join the Suzan Two departure at Dvine, at the published altitude, and then comply with the published lateral path and any published speed or altitude restrictions.\nPilots cleared for vertical navigation using the phraseology \u201cclimb via\u201d must inform ATC, upon initial contact, of the altitude leaving and any assigned restrictions not published on the procedure.\n\nEXAMPLE-(Cactus 711 is cleared to climb via the Laura Two departure.

Pilots must still comply with all speed restrictions and lateral path requirements published on the SID unless canceled by ATC.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nPrior to takeoff or after departure ATC issues an altitude change clearance to an aircraft cleared to climb via a SID but ATC no longer requires compliance with published altitude restrictions:\u201cClimb and maintain flight level two four zero.\u201d\nNOTE-\nThe published SID altitude restrictions are canceled; The aircraft should comply with the SID lateral path and begin an unrestricted climb to FL240. Compliance with published speed restrictions is still required unless specifically deleted by ATC.\n\nAltitude restrictions published on an ODP are necessary for obstacle clearance and/or design constraints. Crossing altitudes and speed restrictions on ODPs cannot be canceled or amended by ATC.\n\nPBN Departure Procedures\n\nAll public PBN SIDs and graphic ODPs are normally designed using RNAV 1, RNP 1, or A-RNP NavSpecs. These procedures generally start with an initial track or heading leg near the departure end of runway (DER). In addition, these procedures require system performance currently met by GPS or DME/DME/IRU PBN systems that satisfy the criteria discussed in the latest AC 90-100, U.S. Terminal and En Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations. RNAV 1 and RNP 1 procedures must maintain a total system error of not more than 1 NM for 95 percent of the total flight time. Minimum values for A-RNP procedures will be charted in the PBN box (for example, 1.00 or 0.30).\n\n\nIn the U.S., a specific procedure's PBN requirements will be prominently displayed in separate, standardized notes boxes. For procedures with PBN elements, the \u201cPBN box\u201d will contain the procedure's NavSpec(s); and, if required: specific sensors or infrastructure needed for the navigation solution, any additional or advanced functional requirements, the minimum RNP value, and any amplifying remarks. Items listed in this PBN box are REQUIRED for the procedure's PBN elements."

Additionally, the Department of Defense has been issued an authorization to operate aircraft at indicated airspeeds in excess of 250\u2009knots below 10,000 feet MSL within active MOAs.\n\nPilots operating under VFR should exercise extreme caution while flying within a MOA when military activity is being conducted. The activity status (active/inactive) of MOAs may change frequently. Therefore, pilots should contact any FSS within 100 miles of the area to obtain accurate real\u2010time information concerning the MOA hours of operation. Prior to entering an active MOA, pilots should contact the controlling agency for traffic advisories.\n\nPermanent MOAs are charted on Sectional Aeronautical, VFR Terminal Area, and the appropriate En Route Low Altitude charts.\n\nNOTE-\nTemporary MOAs are not charted."

A part of the FAA's continuing effort to promote increased aviation safety is the Aviation Safety Program. For information on Aviation Safety Program activities contact your nearest Flight Standards District Office.\n\nAlertness. Be alert at all times, especially when the weather is good. Most pilots pay attention to business when they are operating in full IFR weather conditions, but strangely, air collisions almost invariably have occurred under ideal weather conditions. Unlimited visibility appears to encourage a sense of security which is not at all justified. Considerable information of value may be obtained by listening to advisories being issued in the terminal area, even though controller workload may prevent a pilot from obtaining individual service.\n\nGiving Way. If you think another aircraft is too close to you, give way instead of waiting for the other pilot to respect the right\u2010of\u2010way to which you may be entitled. It is a lot safer to pursue the right\u2010of\u2010way angle after you have completed your flight."

                "section-content": "Background.\n\nThe radio altimeter (also known as radar altimeter or RADALT) is a safety-critical aircraft system used to determine an aircraft's height above terrain. It is the only sensor onboard the aircraft capable of providing a direct measurement of the clearance height above the terrain and obstacles. Information from radio altimeters is essential for flight operations as a main enabler of several safety-critical functions and systems on the aircraft. The receiver on the radio altimeter is highly accurate because it is extremely sensitive, making it susceptible to radio frequency interference (RFI). RFI in the C-band portion of the spectrum could impact the functions of the radio altimeter during any phase of flight\u2014most critically during takeoff, approach, and landing phases. This could pose a serious risk to flight safety.\n\n\nInstalled radio altimeters normally supply critical height data to a wide range of automated safety systems, navigation systems, and cockpit displays. Harmful RFI affecting the radio altimeter can cause these safety and navigation systems to operate in unexpected ways and display erroneous information to the pilot. RFI can interrupt, or significantly degrade, radio altimeter functions\u2014precluding radio altimeter-based terrain alerts and low-visibility approach and landing operations. Systems of concern include Terrain Awareness Warning Systems (TAWS), Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Systems (EGPWS), and Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS), to name a few. Pilots of radio altimeter equipped aircraft should become familiar with the radio altimeter's interdependence with the other aircraft systems and expected failure modes and indications that may be associated with harmful interference.\n\n\nActions. Recognizing interference/anomalies in the radio altimeter can be difficult, as it may present as inoperative or erroneous data. Pilots need to monitor their automation, as well as their radio altimeters for discrepancies, and be prepared to take action. Pilots encountering radio altimeter interference/anomalies should transition to procedures that do not require the radio altimeter, and inform Air Traffic Control (ATC).\n\nInflight Reporting. Pilots should report any radio altimeter anomaly to ATC as soon as practical.\n\nPost Flight Reporting.\n\nPilots are encouraged to submit detailed reports of radio altimeter interference/anomalies post flight as soon as practical, by internet via the Radio Altimeter Anomaly Reporting Form at https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/nas/RADALT_reports/.\n\n\nThe post flight pilot reports of radio altimeter anomalies should contain as much of the following information as applicable:\n\nDate and time the anomaly was observed;\n\n\nLocation of the aircraft at the time the anomaly started and ended (e.g., latitude, longitude or bearing/distance from a reference point or navigational aid);\n\nMagnetic heading;\n\nAltitude (MSL/AGL);\n\nAircraft Type (make/model);\n\nFlight Number or Aircraft Registration Number;\n\nMeteorological conditions;\n\nType of radio altimeter in use (e.g., make/model/software series or version), if known;\n\nEvent overview;\n\nConsequences/operational impact (e.g., impacted equipment, actions taken to mitigate the disruption and/or remedy provided by ATC, required post flight pilot and maintenance actions)."

                "section-title": "Obstructions To Flight",
                "section-content": "General. Many structures exist that could significantly affect the safety of your flight when operating below 500 feet above ground level (AGL), and particularly below 200 feet AGL. While 14 CFR Part 91.119 allows flight below 500 feet AGL when over sparsely populated areas or open water, such operations involve increased safety risks. At and below 200 feet AGL there are numerous power lines, antenna towers, etc., that are not marked and lighted and/or charted as obstructions and, therefore, may not be seen in time to avoid a collision. Notices to Air Missions NOTAMs are issued on those lighted structures experiencing temporary light outages. However, some time may pass before the FAA is notified of these outages, and the NOTAMs issued, thus pilot vigilance is imperative. Additionally, new obstructions may not be on current charts because the information was not received prior to the FAA publishing the chart.\n\n\nAntenna Towers. Extreme caution should be exercised when flying less than 2,000 feet AGL because of numerous skeletal structures, such as radio and television antenna towers, that exceed 1,000 feet AGL with some extending higher than 2,000 feet AGL. Most skeletal structures are supported by guy wires which are very difficult to see in good weather and can be invisible at dusk or during periods of reduced visibility. These wires can extend about 1,500 feet horizontally from a structure; therefore, all skeletal structures should be avoided horizontally by at least 2,000 feet.\n\nOverhead Wires. Overhead transmission and utility lines often span approaches to runways, natural flyways such as lakes, rivers, gorges, and canyons, and cross other landmarks pilots frequently follow such as highways, railroad tracks, etc. As with antenna towers, these power transmission and/or utility lines and the supporting structures of these lines may not always be readily visible. The wires may be virtually impossible to see under certain conditions. Spherical markers may be used to identify overhead wires and catenary transmission lines and may be lighted. In some locations, the supporting structures of overhead transmission lines are equipped with unique sequence flashing white strobe light systems to indicate that there are wires between the structures. The flash sequence for the wire support structures will be middle, top, and bottom with all lights on the same level flashing simultaneously. However, not all power transmission and/or utility lines require notice to the FAA as they do not exceed 200 feet AGL or meet the obstruction standard of 14 CFR Part 77 and, therefore, are not marked and/or lighted. All pilots are cautioned to remain extremely vigilant for power transmission and/or utility lines and their supporting structures when following natural flyways or during the approach and landing phase. This is particularly important for seaplane and/or float equipped aircraft when landing on, or departing from, unfamiliar lakes or rivers.\n\nWind Turbines. The number, size, and height of individual wind turbines and wind turbine farms have increased over time. The locations of wind turbine farms have also expanded to areas more commonly flown by VFR pilots and to all regions of the United States. VFR pilots should be aware that many wind turbines are exceeding 499 feet AGL in height, which may affect minimum safe VFR altitudes in uncontrolled airspace. In addition, many wind turbines are encroaching on the 700 foot AGL floor of controlled airspace (Class E). Pilots are cautioned to maintain appropriate safe distance (laterally, vertically, or both). Wind turbines are typically charted on Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Sectional Charts and/or Terminal Area Charts. For a description of how wind turbines and wind turbine farms are charted, refer to the FAA Aeronautical Chart User's Guide. Wind turbines are normally painted white or light gray to improve daytime conspicuity. They are typically lit with medium-intensity, flashing red lights, placed as high as possible on the turbine nacelle (not the blade tips), that should be synchronized to flash together; however, not all wind turbine units within a farm need to be lighted, depending on their location and height. Sometimes, only the perimeter of the wind turbine farm and an arrangement of interior wind turbines are lit. Some wind turbine farms use Aircraft Detection Lighting Systems (ADLS), which are proximity sensor-based systems designed to detect aircraft as they approach the obstruction. This system automatically activates the appropriate obstruction lights until they are no longer needed based on the position of the transiting aircraft. This technology reduces the impact of nighttime lighting on nearby communities and migratory birds and extends the life expectancy of the obstruction lights. For more information on how obstructions such as wind turbines are marked and lighted, refer to Advisory Circular 70/7460-1, Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Pilots should be aware that wind turbines in motion could result in limitations of air traffic services in the vicinity of the wind turbine farms.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 4-5-1, Radar.\n\n\nMeteorological (MET) Evaluation Towers. MET towers are used by wind energy companies to determine feasible sites for wind turbines. Some of these towers are less than 200 feet AGL. These structures are portable, erected in a matter of hours, installed with guyed wires, and constructed from a galvanized material often making them difficult to see in certain atmospheric conditions. Markings for these towers include alternating bands of aviation orange and white paint, and high-visibility sleeves installed on the outer guy wires. However, not all MET towers follow these guidelines, and pilots should be vigilant when flying at low altitude in remote or rural areas.\n\nOther Objects/Structures. There are other objects or structures that could adversely affect your flight such as temporary construction cranes near an airport, newly constructed buildings, new towers, etc. Many of these structures do not meet charting requirements or may not yet be charted because of the charting cycle. Some structures do not require obstruction marking and/or lighting, and some may not be marked and lighted even though the FAA recommended it. VFR pilots should carefully review NOTAMS for temporary or permanent obstructions along the planned route of flight during their preflight preparations. Particular emphasis should be given to obstructions in the vicinity of the approach and departure ends of the runway complex or any other areas where flight below 500 feet AGL is planned or likely to occur."

Therefore, good judgment on the part of the pilot dictates that aircraft should remain well clear of all unmanned free balloons and flight below them should be avoided at all times.\n\n\nPilots are urged to report any unmanned free balloons sighted to the nearest FAA ground facility with which communication is established. Such information will assist FAA ATC facilities to identify and flight follow unmanned free balloons operating in the airspace."

Once the exclusive domain of the military, UAS are now being operated by various entities. Although these aircraft are \u201cunmanned,\u201d UAS are flown by a remotely located pilot and crew. Physical and performance characteristics of unmanned aircraft (UA) vary greatly and unlike model aircraft that typically operate lower than 400 feet AGL, UA may be found operating at virtually any altitude and any speed. Sizes of UA can be as small as several pounds to as large as a commercial transport aircraft. UAS come in various categories including airplane, rotorcraft, powered-lift (tilt-rotor), and lighter-than-air. Propulsion systems of UAS include a broad range of alternatives from piston powered and turbojet engines to battery and solar-powered electric motors.\n\n\nTo ensure segregation of UAS operations from other aircraft, the military typically conducts UAS operations within restricted or other special use airspace. However, UAS operations are now being approved in the NAS outside of special use airspace through the use of FAA-issued Certificates of Waiver or Authorization (COA) or through the issuance of a special airworthiness certificate. COA and special airworthiness approvals authorize UAS flight operations to be contained within specific geographic boundaries and altitudes, usually require coordination with an ATC facility, and typically require the issuance of a NOTAM describing the operation to be conducted. UAS approvals also require observers to provide \u201csee-and-avoid\u201d capability to the UAS crew and to provide the necessary compliance with 14 CFR Section 91.113. For UAS operations approved at or above FL180, UAS operate under the same requirements as that of manned aircraft (i.e., flights are operated under instrument flight rules, are in communication with ATC, and are appropriately equipped).\n\nUAS operations may be approved at either controlled or uncontrolled airports and are typically disseminated by NOTAM. In all cases, approved UAS operations must comply with all applicable regulations and/or special provisions specified in the COA or in the operating limitations of the special airworthiness certificate. At uncontrolled airports, UAS operations are advised to operate well clear of all known manned aircraft operations. Pilots of manned aircraft are advised to follow normal operating procedures and are urged to monitor the CTAF for any potential UAS activity. At controlled airports, local ATC procedures may be in place to handle UAS operations and should not require any special procedures from manned aircraft entering or departing the traffic pattern or operating in the vicinity of the airport.\n\nIn addition to approved UAS operations described above, a recently approved agreement between the FAA and the Department of Defense authorizes small UAS operations wholly contained within Class G airspace, and in no instance, greater than 1200 feet AGL over military owned or leased property. These operations do not require any special authorization as long as the UA remains within the lateral boundaries of the military installation as well as other provisions including the issuance of a NOTAM. Unlike special use airspace, these areas may not be depicted on an aeronautical chart.\n\nThere are several factors a pilot should consider regarding UAS activity in an effort to reduce potential flight hazards. Pilots are urged to exercise increased vigilance when operating in the vicinity of restricted or other special use airspace, military operations areas, and any military installation. Areas with a preponderance of UAS activity are typically noted on sectional charts advising pilots of this activity. Since the size of a UA can be very small, they may be difficult to see and track. If a UA is encountered during flight, as with manned aircraft, never assume that the pilot or crew of the UAS can see you, maintain increased vigilance with the UA and always be prepared for evasive action if necessary. Always check NOTAMs for potential UAS activity along the intended route of flight and exercise increased vigilance in areas specified in the NOTAM."

                "section-title": "Mountain Flying",
                "section-content": "Your first experience of flying over mountainous terrain (particularly if most of your flight time has been over the flatlands of the Midwest) could be a never\u2010to\u2010be\u2010forgotten nightmare if proper planning is not done and if you are not aware of the potential hazards awaiting. Those familiar section lines are not present in the mountains; those flat, level fields for forced landings are practically nonexistent; abrupt changes in wind direction and velocity occur; severe updrafts and downdrafts are common, particularly near or above abrupt changes of terrain such as cliffs or rugged areas; even the clouds look different and can build up with startling rapidity. Mountain flying need not be hazardous if you follow the recommendations below.\n\n\nFile a Flight Plan. Plan your route to avoid topography which would prevent a safe forced landing. The route should be over populated areas and well known mountain passes. Sufficient altitude should be maintained to permit gliding to a safe landing in the event of engine failure.\n\nDon't fly a light aircraft when the winds aloft, at your proposed altitude, exceed 35 miles per hour. Expect the winds to be of much greater velocity over mountain passes than reported a few miles from them. Approach mountain passes with as much altitude as possible. Downdrafts of from 1,500 to 2,000 feet per minute are not uncommon on the leeward side.\n\nDon't fly near or above abrupt changes in terrain. Severe turbulence can be expected, especially in high wind conditions.\n\nUnderstand Mountain Obscuration. The term Mountain Obscuration (MTOS) is used to describe a visibility condition that is distinguished from IFR because ceilings, by definition, are described as \u201cabove ground level\u201d (AGL). In mountainous terrain clouds can form at altitudes significantly higher than the weather reporting station and at the same time nearby mountaintops may be obscured by low visibility. In these areas the ground level can also vary greatly over a small area. Beware if operating VFR-on-top. You could be operating closer to the terrain than you think because the tops of mountains are hidden in a cloud deck below. MTOS areas are identified daily on The Aviation Weather Center located at: http://www.aviationweather.gov.\n\nNavigating in confined terrain when flying through mountain passes can be challenging. For high-traffic mountain passes, VFR checkpoints may be provided on VFR navigation charts to increase situational awareness by indicating key landmarks inside confined terrain. A collocated VFR waypoint and checkpoint may be provided to assist with identifying natural entry points for commonly flown mountain passes. Pilots should reference the name of the charted VFR checkpoint, wherever possible, when making position reports on CTAF frequencies to reduce the risk of midair collisions. Pilots should evaluate the terrain along the route they intend to fly with respect to their aircraft type and performance capabilities, local weather, and their experience level to avoid flying into confined areas without adequate room to execute a 180 degree turn, should conditions require. Always fly with a planned escape route in mind.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 1-1-17, Global Positioning System (GPS).\n\n\nVFR flight operations may be conducted at night in mountainous terrain with the application of sound judgment and common sense. Proper pre\u2010flight planning, giving ample consideration to winds and weather, knowledge of the terrain and pilot experience in mountain flying are prerequisites for safety of flight. Continuous visual contact with the surface and obstructions is a major concern and flight operations under an overcast or in the vicinity of clouds should be approached with extreme caution.\n\nWhen landing at a high altitude field, the same indicated airspeed should be used as at low elevation fields. Remember: that due to the less dense air at altitude, this same indicated airspeed actually results in higher true airspeed, a faster landing speed, and more important, a longer landing distance. During gusty wind conditions which often prevail at high altitude fields, a power approach and power landing is recommended. Additionally, due to the faster groundspeed, your takeoff distance will increase considerably over that required at low altitudes.\n\nEffects of Density Altitude. Performance figures in the aircraft owner's handbook for length of takeoff run, horsepower, rate of climb, etc., are generally based on standard atmosphere conditions (59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius), pressure 29.92 inches of mercury) at sea level. However, inexperienced pilots, as well as experienced pilots, may run into trouble when they encounter an altogether different set of conditions. This is particularly true in hot weather and at higher elevations. Aircraft operations at altitudes above sea level and at higher than standard temperatures are commonplace in mountainous areas. Such operations quite often result in a drastic reduction of aircraft performance capabilities because of the changing air density. Density altitude is a measure of air density. It is not to be confused with pressure altitude, true altitude, or absolute altitude. It is not to be used as a height reference, but as a determining criteria in the performance capability of an aircraft. Air density decreases with altitude. As air density decreases, density altitude increases. The further effects of high temperature and high humidity are cumulative, resulting in an increasing high density altitude condition. High density altitude reduces all aircraft performance parameters. To the pilot, this means that the normal horsepower output is reduced, propeller efficiency is reduced, and a higher true airspeed is required to sustain the aircraft throughout its operating parameters. It means an increase in runway length requirements for takeoff and landings, and decreased rate of climb. An average small airplane, for example, requiring 1,000 feet for takeoff at sea level under standard atmospheric conditions will require a takeoff run of approximately 2,000 feet at an operational altitude of 5,000 feet.\n\nNOTE-\nA turbo\u2010charged aircraft engine provides a slight advantage in that it provides sea level horsepower up to a specified altitude above sea level.\n\nDensity Altitude Advisories. At airports with elevations of 2,000 feet and higher, control towers and FSSs will broadcast the advisory \u201cCheck Density Altitude\u201d when the temperature reaches a predetermined level. These advisories will be broadcast on appropriate tower frequencies or, where available, ATIS. FSSs will broadcast these advisories as a part of Local Airport Advisory.\n\n\nThese advisories are provided by air traffic facilities, as a reminder to pilots that high temperatures and high field elevations will cause significant changes in aircraft characteristics. The pilot retains the responsibility to compute density altitude, when appropriate, as a part of preflight duties.\n\nNOTE-\nAll FSSs will compute the current density altitude upon request.\n\nMountain Wave. Many pilots go all their lives without understanding what a mountain wave is. Quite a few have lost their lives because of this lack of understanding. One need not be a licensed meteorologist to understand the mountain wave phenomenon.\n\nMountain waves occur when air is being blown over a mountain range or even the ridge of a sharp bluff area. As the air hits the upwind side of the range, it starts to climb, thus creating what is generally a smooth updraft which turns into a turbulent downdraft as the air passes the crest of the ridge. From this point, for many miles downwind, there will be a series of downdrafts and updrafts. Satellite photos of the Rockies have shown mountain waves extending as far as 700 miles downwind of the range. Along the east coast area, such photos of the Appalachian chain have picked up the mountain wave phenomenon over a hundred miles eastward. All it takes to form a mountain wave is wind blowing across the range at 15 knots or better at an intersection angle of not less than 30 degrees.\n\n\nPilots from flatland areas should understand a few things about mountain waves in order to stay out of trouble. When approaching a mountain range from the upwind side (generally the west), there will usually be a smooth updraft; therefore, it is not quite as dangerous an area as the lee of the range. From the leeward side, it is always a good idea to add an extra thousand feet or so of altitude because downdrafts can exceed the climb capability of the aircraft. Never expect an updraft when approaching a mountain chain from the leeward. Always be prepared to cope with a downdraft and turbulence.\n\nWhen approaching a mountain ridge from the downwind side, it is recommended that the ridge be approached at approximately a 45 degree angle to the horizontal direction of the ridge. This permits a safer retreat from the ridge with less stress on the aircraft should severe turbulence and downdraft be experienced. If severe turbulence is encountered, simultaneously reduce power and adjust pitch until aircraft approaches maneuvering speed, then adjust power and trim to maintain maneuvering speed and fly away from the turbulent area."

Puddles, soft spots, areas of tall and/or wet grass, loose gravel, etc., may impede acceleration or even cause deceleration. Even if the airplane achieves 70 percent of liftoff airspeed by the midpoint, the condition of the remainder of the runway may not allow further acceleration. The entire length of the runway should be inspected prior to takeoff to ensure a usable surface.\n\nThis \u201crule of thumb\u201d applies only to runway required for actual liftoff. In the event that obstacles affect the takeoff climb path, appropriate distance must be available after liftoff to accelerate to best angle of climb speed and to clear the obstacles. This will, in effect, require the airplane to accelerate to a higher speed by midpoint, particularly if the obstacles are close to the end of the runway. In addition, this technique does not take into account the effects of upslope or tailwinds on takeoff performance. These factors will also require greater acceleration than normal and, under some circumstances, prevent takeoff entirely.\n\nUse of this \u201crule of thumb\u201d does not alleviate the pilot's responsibility to comply with applicable Federal Aviation Regulations, the limitations and performance data provided in the FAA approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), or, in the absence of an FAA approved AFM, other data provided by the aircraft manufacturer.\nIn addition to their use during takeoff, runway half-way signs offer the pilot increased awareness of his or her position along the runway during landing operations.\nNOTE-\nNo FAA standard exists for the appearance of the runway half-way sign.

Seaplane pilots must be vigilant for hazards such as electric power lines, power, sail and rowboats, rafts, mooring lines, water skiers, swimmers, etc.\n\n\nSeaplane pilots must have a thorough understanding of the right\u2010of\u2010way rules as they apply to aircraft versus other vessels. Seaplane pilots are expected to know and adhere to both the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG) Navigation Rules, International-Inland, and 14 CFR Section 91.115, Right-of-Way Rules; Water Operations. The navigation rules of the road are a set of collision avoidance rules as they apply to aircraft on the water. A seaplane is considered a vessel when on the water for the purposes of these collision avoidance rules. In general, a seaplane on the water must keep well clear of all vessels and avoid impeding their navigation. The CFR requires, in part, that aircraft operating on the water \u201c. . . shall, insofar as possible, keep clear of all vessels and avoid impeding their navigation, and shall give way to any vessel or other aircraft that is given the right-of-way . . . .\u201d This means that a seaplane should avoid boats and commercial shipping when on the water. If on a collision course, the seaplane should slow, stop, or maneuver to the right, away from the bow of the oncoming vessel. Also, while on the surface with an engine running, an aircraft must give way to all nonpowered vessels. Since a seaplane in the water may not be as maneuverable as one in the air, the aircraft on the water has right\u2010of\u2010way over one in the air, and one taking off has right\u2010of\u2010way over one landing. A seaplane is exempt from the USCG safety equipment requirements, including the requirements for Personal Flotation Devices (PFD). Requiring seaplanes on the water to comply with USCG equipment requirements in addition to the FAA equipment requirements would be an unnecessary burden on seaplane owners and operators.\n\nUnless they are under Federal jurisdiction, navigable bodies of water are under the jurisdiction of the state, or in a few cases, privately owned. Unless they are specifically restricted, aircraft have as much right to operate on these bodies of water as other vessels. To avoid problems, check with Federal or local officials in advance of operating on unfamiliar waters. In addition to the agencies listed in TBL 7-6-1, the nearest Flight Standards District Office can usually offer some practical suggestions as well as regulatory information. If you land on a restricted body of water because of an inflight emergency, or in ignorance of the restrictions you have violated, report as quickly as practical to the nearest local official having jurisdiction and explain your situation.\n\nWhen operating a seaplane over or into remote areas, appropriate attention should be given to survival gear. Minimum kits are recommended for summer and winter, and are required by law for flight into sparsely settled areas of Canada and Alaska. Alaska State Department of Transportation and Canadian Ministry of Transport officials can provide specific information on survival gear requirements. The kit should be assembled in one container and be easily reachable and preferably floatable.\nTBL 7-6-1Jurisdictions Controlling Navigable Bodies of Water\n\n\n\nAuthority to Consult For Use of a Body of Water\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\nAuthority\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n\nWilderness Area\n\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service\n\n\nLocal forest ranger\n\n\n\n\nNational Forest\n\n\nUSDA Forest Service\n\n\nLocal forest ranger\n\n\n\n\nNational Park\n\n\nU.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service\n\n\nLocal park ranger\n\n\n\n\nIndian Reservation\n\n\nUSDI, Bureau of Indian Affairs\n\n\nLocal Bureau office\n\n\n\n\nState Park\n\n\nState government or state forestry or park service\n\n\nLocal state aviation office for further information\n\n\n\n\nCanadian National and Provincial Parks\n\n\nSupervised and restricted on an individual basis from province to province and by different departments of the Canadian government; consult Canadian Flight Information Manual and/or Water Aerodrome Supplement\n\n\nPark Superintendent in an emergency\n\n\n\nThe FAA recommends that each seaplane owner or operator provide flotation gear for occupants any time a seaplane operates on or near water. 14 CFR Section 91.205(b)(12) requires approved flotation gear for aircraft operated for hire over water and beyond power\u2010off gliding distance from shore. FAA\u2010approved gear differs from that required for navigable waterways under USCG rules. FAA\u2010approved life vests are inflatable designs as compared to the USCG's noninflatable PFD's that may consist of solid, bulky material. Such USCG PFDs are impractical for seaplanes and other aircraft because they may block passage through the relatively narrow exits available to pilots and passengers. Life vests approved under Technical Standard Order (TSO) TSO-C13E contain fully inflatable compartments. The wearer inflates the compartments (AFTER exiting the aircraft) primarily by independent CO2 cartridges, with an oral inflation tube as a backup. The flotation gear also contains a water\u2010activated, self\u2010illuminating signal light. The fact that pilots and passengers can easily don and wear inflatable life vests (when not inflated) provides maximum effectiveness and allows for unrestricted movement. It is imperative that passengers are briefed on the location and proper use of available PFDs prior to leaving the dock.\n\nThe FAA recommends that seaplane owners and operators obtain Advisory Circular (AC) 91-69, Seaplane Safety for 14 CFR Part 91 Operations, free from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Subsequent Distribution Office, SVC-121.23, Ardmore East Business Center, 3341 Q 75th Avenue, Landover, MD  20785; fax: (301) 386-5394.

                "section-content": "Severe volcanic eruptions which send ash and sulphur dioxide (SO2) gas into the upper atmosphere occur somewhere around the world several times each year. Flying into a volcanic ash cloud can be exceedingly dangerous. A B747-200 lost all four engines after such an encounter and a B747-400 had the same nearly catastrophic experience. Piston-powered aircraft are less likely to lose power but severe damage is almost certain to ensue after an encounter with a volcanic ash cloud which is only a few hours old.\n\n\nMost important is to avoid any encounter with volcanic ash. The ash plume may not be visible, especially in instrument conditions or at night; and even if visible, it is difficult to distinguish visually between an ash cloud and an ordinary weather cloud. Volcanic ash clouds are not displayed on airborne or ATC radar. The pilot must rely on reports from air traffic controllers and other pilots to determine the location of the ash cloud and use that information to remain well clear of the area. Additionally, the presence of a sulphur-like odor throughout the cabin may indicate the presence of SO2 emitted by volcanic activity, but may or may not indicate the presence of volcanic ash. Every attempt should be made to remain on the upwind side of the volcano.\n\nIt is recommended that pilots encountering an ash cloud should immediately reduce thrust to idle (altitude permitting), and reverse course in order to escape from the cloud. Ash clouds may extend for hundreds of miles and pilots should not attempt to fly through or climb out of the cloud. In addition, the following procedures are recommended:\n\nDisengage the autothrottle if engaged. This will prevent the autothrottle from increasing engine thrust;\n\n\nTurn on continuous ignition;\n\nTurn on all accessory airbleeds including all air conditioning packs, nacelles, and wing anti\u2010ice. This will provide an additional engine stall margin by reducing engine pressure.\n\nThe following has been reported by flightcrews who have experienced encounters with volcanic dust clouds:\n\nSmoke or dust appearing in the cockpit.\n\n\nAn acrid odor similar to electrical smoke.\n\nMultiple engine malfunctions, such as compressor stalls, increasing EGT, torching from tailpipe, and flameouts.\n\nAt night, St. Elmo's fire or other static discharges accompanied by a bright orange glow in the engine inlets.\n\nA fire warning in the forward cargo area.\n\nIt may become necessary to shut down and then restart engines to prevent exceeding EGT limits. Volcanic ash may block the pitot system and result in unreliable airspeed indications.\n\nIf you see a volcanic eruption and have not been previously notified of it, you may have been the first person to observe it. In this case, immediately contact ATC and alert them to the existence of the eruption. If possible, use the Volcanic Activity Reporting form (VAR) depicted in Appendix 2 of this manual. Items\u20091 through 8 of the VAR should be transmitted immediately. The information requested in items\u20099\u2009through 16 should be passed after landing. If a VAR form is not immediately available, relay enough information to identify the position and nature of the volcanic activity. Do not become unnecessarily alarmed if there is merely steam or very low\u2010level eruptions of ash.\n\nWhen landing at airports where volcanic ash has been deposited on the runway, be aware that even a thin layer of dry ash can be detrimental to braking action. Wet ash on the runway may also reduce effectiveness of braking. It is recommended that reverse thrust be limited to minimum practical to reduce the possibility of reduced visibility and engine ingestion of airborne ash.\n\nWhen departing from airports where volcanic ash has been deposited, it is recommended that pilots avoid operating in visible airborne ash. Allow ash to settle before initiating takeoff roll. It is also recommended that flap extension be delayed until initiating the before takeoff checklist and that a rolling takeoff be executed to avoid blowing ash back into the air."

Most pilots receive little, if any, formal training or instruction in this type of flying activity. Close proximity flying without sufficient time to plan (i.e., in an emergency situation), coupled with the stress involved in a perceived emergency can be hazardous.\n\n\nThe pilot in the best position to assess the situation should take the responsibility of coordinating the airborne intercept and inspection, and take into account the unique flight characteristics and differences of the category(s) of aircraft involved.\n\nSome of the safety considerations are:\n\nArea, direction and speed of the intercept;\n\n\nAerodynamic effects (i.e., rotorcraft downwash);\n\nMinimum safe separation distances;\n\nCommunications requirements, lost communications procedures, coordination with ATC;\n\nSuitability of diverting the distressed aircraft to the nearest safe airport; and\n\nEmergency actions to terminate the intercept.\n\nClose proximity, inflight inspection of another aircraft is uniquely hazardous.

                "section-title": "Precipitation Static",
                "section-content": "Precipitation static is caused by aircraft in flight coming in contact with uncharged particles. These particles can be rain, snow, fog, sleet, hail, volcanic ash, dust; any solid or liquid particles. When the aircraft strikes these neutral particles the positive element of the particle is reflected away from the aircraft and the negative particle adheres to the skin of the aircraft. In a very short period of time a substantial negative charge will develop on the skin of the aircraft. If the aircraft is not equipped with static dischargers, or has an ineffective static discharger system, when a sufficient negative voltage level is reached, the aircraft may go into \u201cCORONA.\u201d That is, it will discharge the static electricity from the extremities of the aircraft, such as the wing tips, horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer, antenna, propeller tips, etc. This discharge of static electricity is what you will hear in your headphones and is what we call P-static.\n\n\nA review of pilot reports often shows different symptoms with each problem that is encountered. The following list of problems is a summary of many pilot reports from many different aircraft. Each problem was caused by P-static:\n\nComplete loss of VHF communications.\n\n\nErroneous magnetic compass readings (30\u2009percent in error).\n\nHigh pitched squeal on audio.\n\nMotor boat sound on audio.\n\nLoss of all avionics in clouds.\n\nVLF navigation system inoperative most of the time.\n\nErratic instrument readouts.\n\nWeak transmissions and poor receptivity of radios.\n\n\u201cSt. Elmo's Fire\u201d on windshield.\n\nEach of these symptoms is caused by one general problem on the airframe. This problem is the inability of the accumulated charge to flow easily to the wing tips and tail of the airframe, and properly discharge to the airstream.\n\nStatic dischargers work on the principal of creating a relatively easy path for discharging negative charges that develop on the aircraft by using a discharger with fine metal points, carbon coated rods, or carbon wicks rather than wait until a large charge is developed and discharged off the trailing edges of the aircraft that will interfere with avionics equipment. This process offers approximately 50\u2009decibels (dB) static noise reduction which is adequate in most cases to be below the threshold of noise that would cause interference in avionics equipment.\n\nIt is important to remember that precipitation static problems can only be corrected with the proper number of quality static dischargers, properly installed on a properly bonded aircraft. P-static is indeed a problem in the all weather operation of the aircraft, but there are effective ways to combat it. All possible methods of reducing the effects of P-static should be considered so as to provide the best possible performance in the flight environment.\n\nA wide variety of discharger designs is available on the commercial market. The inclusion of well-designed dischargers may be expected to improve airframe noise in P-static conditions by as much as 50 dB. Essentially, the discharger provides a path by which accumulated charge may leave the airframe quietly. This is generally accomplished by providing a group of tiny corona points to permit onset of corona-current flow at a low aircraft potential. Additionally, aerodynamic design of dischargers to permit corona to occur at the lowest possible atmospheric pressure also lowers the corona threshold. In addition to permitting a low-potential discharge, the discharger will minimize the radiation of radio frequency (RF) energy which accompanies the corona discharge, in order to minimize effects of RF components at communications and navigation frequencies on avionics performance. These effects are reduced through resistive attachment of the corona point(s) to the airframe, preserving direct current connection but attenuating the higher-frequency components of the discharge.\n\nEach manufacturer of static dischargers offers information concerning appropriate discharger location on specific airframes. Such locations emphasize the trailing outboard surfaces of wings and horizontal tail surfaces, plus the tip of the vertical stabilizer, where charge tends to accumulate on the airframe. Sufficient dischargers must be provided to allow for current-carrying capacity which will maintain airframe potential below the corona threshold of the trailing edges.\n\nIn order to achieve full performance of avionic equipment, the static discharge system will require periodic maintenance. A pilot knowledgeable of P-static causes and effects is an important element in assuring optimum performance by early recognition of these types of problems."

                "section-content": "Lasers have many applications. Of concern to users of the National Airspace System are those laser events that may affect pilots, e.g., outdoor laser light shows or demonstrations for entertainment and advertisements at special events and theme parks. Generally, the beams from these events appear as bright blue-green in color; however, they may be red, yellow, or white. However, some laser systems produce light which is invisible to the human eye.\n\n\nFAA regulations prohibit the disruption of aviation activity by any person on the ground or in the air. The FAA and the Food and Drug Administration (the Federal agency that has the responsibility to enforce compliance with Federal requirements for laser systems and laser light show products) are working together to ensure that operators of these devices do not pose a hazard to aircraft operators.\n\nPilots should be aware that illumination from these laser operations are able to create temporary vision impairment miles from the actual location. In addition, these operations can produce permanent eye damage. Pilots should make themselves aware of where these activities are being conducted and avoid these areas if possible.\n\nRecent and increasing incidents of unauthorized illumination of aircraft by lasers, as well as the proliferation and increasing sophistication of laser devices available to the general public, dictates that the FAA, in coordination with other government agencies, take action to safeguard flights from these unauthorized illuminations.\n\nPilots should report laser illumination activity to the controlling Air Traffic Control facilities, Federal Contract Towers or Flight Service Stations as soon as possible after the event. The following information should be included:\n\nUTC Date and Time of Event.\n\n\nCall Sign or Aircraft Registration Number.\n\nType Aircraft.\n\nNearest Major City.\n\nAltitude.\n\nLocation of Event (Latitude/Longitude and/or Fixed Radial Distance (FRD)).\n\nBrief Description of the Event and any other Pertinent Information.\n\nPilots are also encouraged to complete the Laser\u2009Beam Exposure Questionnaire located on\u2009the\u2009FAA\u2009Laser Safety Initiative website at http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers/ and\u2009submit electronically per the directions on the questionnaire, as soon as possible after landing.\n\nWhen a laser event is reported to an air traffic facility, a general caution warning will be broadcasted on all appropriate frequencies every five\u2009minutes for 20 minutes and broadcasted on the ATIS for one hour following the report.\n\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nUNAUTHORIZED LASER ILLUMINATION EVENT, (UTC time), (location), (altitude), (color), (direction).\n\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cUnauthorized laser illumination event, at 0100z, 8 mile final runway 18R at 3,000 feet, green laser from the southwest.\u201d\nREFERENCE-\n\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 10-2-14, Unauthorized Laser Illumination of Aircraft.\nFAA Order JO 7210.3, Para 2-1-27, Reporting Unauthorized Laser Illumination of Aircraft.\n\n\nWhen these activities become known to the FAA, Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs) are issued to inform the aviation community of the events.

                "section-title": "Flying in Flat Light, Brown Out Conditions, and White Out Conditions",
                "section-content": "Flat Light. Flat light is an optical illusion, also known as \u201csector or partial white out.\u201d It is not as severe as \u201cwhite out\u201d but the condition causes pilots to lose their depth-of-field and contrast in vision. Flat light conditions are usually accompanied by overcast skies inhibiting any visual clues. Such conditions can occur anywhere in the world, primarily in snow covered areas but can occur in dust, sand, mud flats, or on glassy water. Flat light can completely obscure features of the terrain, creating an inability to distinguish distances and closure rates. As a result of this reflected light, it can give pilots the illusion that they are ascending or descending when they may actually be flying level. However, with good judgment and proper training and planning, it is possible to safely operate an aircraft in flat light conditions.\n\n\nBrown Out. A brownout (or brown-out) is an in-flight visibility restriction due to dust or sand in the air. In a brownout, the pilot cannot see nearby objects which provide the outside visual references necessary to control the aircraft near the ground. This can cause spatial disorientation and loss of situational awareness leading to an accident.\n\nThe following factors will affect the probability and severity of brownout: rotor disk loading, rotor configuration, soil composition, wind, approach speed, and approach angle.\n\n\nThe brownout phenomenon causes accidents during helicopter landing and take-off operations in dust, fine dirt, sand, or arid desert terrain. Intense, blinding dust clouds stirred up by the helicopter rotor downwash during near-ground flight causes significant flight safety risks from aircraft and ground obstacle collisions, and dynamic rollover due to sloped and uneven terrain.\n\nThis is a dangerous phenomenon experienced by many helicopters when making landing approaches in dusty environments, whereby sand or dust particles become swept up in the rotor outwash and obscure the pilot's vision of the terrain. This is particularly dangerous because the pilot needs those visual cues from their surroundings in order to make a safe landing.\n\nBlowing sand and dust can cause an illusion of a tilted horizon. A pilot not using the flight instruments for reference may instinctively try to level the aircraft with respect to the false horizon, resulting in an accident. Helicopter rotor wash also causes sand to blow around outside the cockpit windows, possibly leading the pilot to experience an illusion where the helicopter appears to be turning when it is actually in a level hover. This can also cause the pilot to make incorrect control inputs which can quickly lead to disaster when hovering near the ground. In night landings, aircraft lighting can enhance the visual illusions by illuminating the brownout cloud.\n\nWhite Out. As defined in meteorological terms, white out occurs when a person becomes engulfed in a uniformly white glow. The glow is a result of being surrounded by blowing snow, dust, sand, mud or water. There are no shadows, no horizon or clouds and all depth-of-field and orientation are lost. A white out situation is severe in that there are no visual references. Flying is not recommended in any white out situation. Flat light conditions can lead to a white out environment quite rapidly, and both atmospheric conditions are insidious; they sneak up on you as your visual references slowly begin to disappear. White out has been the cause of several aviation accidents.\n\nSelf Induced White Out. This effect typically occurs when a helicopter takes off or lands on a snow-covered area. The rotor down wash picks up particles and re-circulates them through the rotor down wash. The effect can vary in intensity depending upon the amount of light on the surface.  This can happen on the sunniest, brightest day with good contrast everywhere. However, when it happens, there can be a complete loss of visual clues.  If the pilot has not prepared for this immediate loss of visibility, the results can be disastrous. Good planning does not prevent one from encountering flat light or white out conditions.\n\nNever take off in a white out situation.\n\nRealize that in flat light conditions it may be possible to depart but not to return to that site. During takeoff, make sure you have a reference point. Do not lose sight of it until you have a departure reference point in view. Be prepared to return to the takeoff reference if the departure reference does not come into view.\n\n\nFlat light is common to snow skiers. One way to compensate for the lack of visual contrast and depth-of-field loss is by wearing amber tinted lenses (also known as blue blockers). Special note of caution: Eyewear is not ideal for every pilot. Take into consideration personal factors\u2014age, light sensitivity, and ambient lighting conditions.\n\nSo what should a pilot do when all visual references are lost?\n\nTrust the cockpit instruments.\n\n\nExecute a 180 degree turnaround and start looking for outside references.\n\nAbove all - fly the aircraft.\n\nLanding in Low Light Conditions. When landing in a low light condition - use extreme caution. Look for intermediate reference points, in addition to checkpoints along each leg of the route for course confirmation and timing. The lower the ambient light becomes, the more reference points a pilot should use.\n\nAirport Landings. \n\nLook for features around the airport or approach path that can be used in determining depth perception. Buildings, towers, vehicles or other aircraft serve well for this measurement. Use something that will provide you with a sense of height above the ground, in addition to orienting you to the runway.\n\n\nBe cautious of snowdrifts and snow banks - anything that can distinguish the edge of the runway. Look for subtle changes in snow texture or shading to identify ridges or changes in snow depth.\n\nOff-Airport Landings.\n\nIn the event of an off-airport landing, pilots have used a number of different visual cues to gain reference. Use whatever you must to create the contrast you need. Natural references seem to work best (trees, rocks, snow ribs, etc.)\n\nOver flight.\n\n\nUse of markers.\n\nWeighted flags.\n\nSmoke bombs.\n\nAny colored rags.\n\nDye markers.\n\nKool-aid.\n\nTrees or tree branches.\n\n\nIt is difficult to determine the depth of snow in areas that are level. Dropping items from the aircraft to use as reference points should be used as a visual aid only and not as a primary landing reference. Unless your marker is biodegradable, be sure to retrieve it after landing. Never put yourself in a position where no visual references exist.\n\nAbort landing if blowing snow obscures your reference. Make your decisions early. Don't assume you can pick up a lost reference point when you get closer.\n\nExercise extreme caution when flying from sunlight into shade. Physical awareness may tell you that you are flying straight but you may actually be in a spiral dive with centrifugal force pressing against you. Having no visual references enhances this illusion. Just because you have a good visual reference does not mean that it's safe to continue.  There may be snow-covered terrain not visible in the direction that you are traveling. Getting caught in a no visual reference situation can be fatal.\n\nFlying Around a Lake. \n\nWhen flying along lakeshores, use them as a reference point. Even if you can see the other side, realize that your depth perception may be poor. It is easy to fly into the surface. If you must cross the lake, check the altimeter frequently and maintain a safe altitude while you still have a good reference. Don't descend below that altitude.\n\n\nThe same rules apply to seemingly flat areas of snow. If you don't have good references, avoid going there.\n\nOther Traffic. Be on the look out for other traffic in the area. Other aircraft may be using your same reference point. Chances are greater of colliding with someone traveling in the same direction as you, than someone flying in the opposite direction.\n\nCeilings. Low ceilings have caught many pilots off guard. Clouds do not always form parallel to the surface, or at the same altitude. Pilots may try to compensate for this by flying with a slight bank and thus creating a descending turn.\n\nGlaciers. Be conscious of your altitude when flying over glaciers. The glaciers may be rising faster than you are climbing."

The General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) is the primary vehicle for government-industry cooperation, communication, and coordination on GA accident mitigation. The Turbine Aircraft Operations Subgroup (TAOS) works to mitigate accidents in turbine accident aviation. While there is sufficient information and guidance currently available regarding the effects of icing on aircraft and methods for deicing, the TAOS has developed a list of recommended actions to further assist pilots and operators in this area.\nWhile the efforts of the TAOS specifically focus on turbine aircraft, it is recognized that their recommendations are applicable to and can be adapted for the pilot of a small, piston powered aircraft too.\n\nThe following recommendations are offered:\n\nEnsure that your aircraft's lift-generating surfaces are COMPLETELY free of contamination before flight through a tactile (hands on) check of the critical surfaces when feasible. Even when otherwise permitted, operators should avoid smooth or polished frost on lift-generating surfaces as an acceptable preflight condition.\n\n\nReview and refresh your cold weather standard operating procedures.\n\nReview and be familiar with the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) limitations and procedures necessary to deal with icing conditions prior to flight, as well as in flight.\n\nProtect your aircraft while on the ground, if possible, from sleet and freezing rain by taking advantage of aircraft hangars.\n\nTake full advantage of the opportunities available at airports for deicing. Do not refuse deicing services simply because of cost.\n\nAlways consider canceling or delaying a flight if weather conditions do not support a safe operation.\n\nIf you haven't already developed a set of Standard Operating Procedures for cold weather operations, they should include:\n\nProcedures based on information that is applicable to the aircraft operated, such as AFM limitations and procedures;\n\n\nConcise and easy to understand guidance that outlines best operational practices;\n\nA systematic procedure for recognizing, evaluating and addressing the associated icing risk, and offer clear guidance to mitigate this risk;\n\nAn aid (such as a checklist or reference cards) that is readily available during normal day-to-day aircraft operations.\n\nThere are several sources for guidance relating to airframe icing, including:\n\nhttp://aircrafticing.grc.nasa.gov/index.html\n\n\nAdvisory Circular (AC) 91-74, Pilot Guide, Flight in Icing Conditions.\n\nAC 135-17, Pilot Guide Small Aircraft Ground Deicing.\n\nAC 135-9, FAR Part 135 Icing Limitations.\n\nAC 120-60, Ground Deicing and Anti-icing Program.\n\nAC 135-16, Ground Deicing and Anti-icing Training and Checking.

                "section-content": "Flight Hazards Exist Around Exhaust Plumes. Exhaust plumes are defined as visible or invisible emissions from power plants, industrial production facilities, or other industrial systems that release large amounts of vertically directed unstable gases (effluent). High temperature exhaust plumes can cause significant air disturbances such as turbulence and vertical shear. Other identified potential hazards include, but are not necessarily limited to: reduced visibility, oxygen depletion, engine particulate contamination, exposure to gaseous oxides, and/or icing. Results of encountering a plume may include airframe damage, aircraft upset, and/or engine damage/failure. These hazards are most critical during low altitude flight in calm and cold air, especially in and around approach and departure corridors or airport traffic areas. \n\nWhether plumes are visible or invisible, the total extent of their turbulent affect is difficult to predict. Some studies do predict that the significant turbulent effects of an exhaust plume can extend to heights of over 1,000 feet above the height of the top of the stack or cooling tower. Any effects will be more pronounced in calm stable air where the plume is very hot and the surrounding area is still and cold. Fortunately, studies also predict that any amount of crosswind will help to dissipate the effects. However, the size of the tower or stack is not a good indicator of the predicted effect the plume may produce. The major effects are related to the heat or size of the plume effluent, the ambient air temperature, and the wind speed affecting the plume. Smaller aircraft can expect to feel an effect at a higher altitude than heavier aircraft.\n\n\nWhen able, a pilot should steer clear of exhaust plumes by flying on the upwind side of smokestacks or cooling towers. When a plume is visible via smoke or a condensation cloud, remain clear and realize a plume may have both visible and invisible characteristics. Exhaust stacks without visible plumes may still be in full operation, and airspace in the vicinity should be treated with caution. As with mountain wave turbulence or clear air turbulence, an invisible plume may be encountered unexpectedly. Cooling towers, power plant stacks, exhaust fans, and other similar structures are depicted in FIG 7-6-2.\nPilots are encouraged to exercise caution when flying in the vicinity of exhaust plumes. Pilots are also encouraged to reference the Chart Supplement where amplifying notes may caution pilots and identify the location of structure(s) emitting exhaust plumes.The best available information on this phenomenon must come from pilots via the PIREP reporting procedures. All pilots encountering hazardous plume\u2009conditions are urgently requested to report time, location, and intensity (light, moderate, severe, or extreme) of the element to the FAA facility with which they are maintaining radio contact. If time and conditions permit, elements should be reported according to the standards for other PIREPs and position reports (AIM paragraph 7-1-21, PIREPS Relating to Turbulence).FIG 7-6-2Plumes"

Failure of a recreational flyer to adhere to any of the requirements for recreational status under 14 USC 44809 will result in the flight being considered 14 CFR Part 107 by the FAA, which may result in greater penalties if the operator is found operating in an unsafe manner. Recreational flyers may only operate under the statutory exception if they adhere to all of the conditions listed in the statute.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAC 91-57, Exception for Limited Recreational Operations of Unmanned Aircraft.\n49 USC 44809, Exception for Limited Recreational Operations of Unmanned Aircraft.\n14 CFR Part 107, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems.\n\n\n\nOperations in Class G airspace. Flights in Class G airspace will be the most common environment for many recreational flyers. The upper limit of recreational UAS operations in Class G airspace is 400 feet AGL. When operating in Class G airspace, the recreational flyer must follow the set of safety guidelines outlined and developed by a recognized Community-Based Organization (CBO).\n\nOperations in controlled airspace or uncontrolled airspace above 400 feet AGL. If a recreational flyer desires to operate in class B, C, or D airspace, or within the lateral boundaries of the surface area of class E airspace designated for an airport, or in class G airspace above 400 feet, the operator must obtain prior authorization from the Administrator or designee before operating. For the recreational flyer wishing to enter controlled airspace, there are two basic routes:\n\nFixed sites are locations specifically authorized by the FAA, which are posted at the FAA's interactive map on the UAS Data Delivery System (UDDS). On the map, small blue circles depict the location of these sites in controlled airspace and the altitude limits imposed on those sites. The altitude restrictions are derived from the UASFM which form the basic structure of LAANC and its operating procedures. Recreational flyers can access site-specific information by clicking on the blue circle.\n\nNOTE-\nThese sites have existing letters of agreement or authorization (LOA) with the FAA. For the CBO to operate in controlled airspace, an airspace authorization agreement between the CBO and the FAA must be in place. Certain sites may have access restrictions or other operating limitations, which are available from the site sponsor.\n\n\nBy request, through the LAANC Application. LAANC provides the recreational pilot with access, when permissible, to controlled airspace at or below posted UASFM altitudes in near-real time. LAANC also gives the recreational flyer the ability to stay notified of airspace restrictions and prohibitions. See paragraph 11-8-7 of this chapter for information on downloading the LAANC application.\n\nCBO Sanctioned Events. Sanctioned events, also called sponsored events are generally of short duration and take place at an existing fixed site or temporary fixed site established specifically for the event.\n\nCBO's requesting a sanctioned or sponsored event authorization within Class B, C, D, or within the lateral boundaries of the surface area of Class E airspace designated for an airport are obligated to make the location known to the FAA Administrator. Mutually agreed-upon operating procedures must be established with the event organizer. This is accomplished through a fixed site application in DroneZone.\n\n\nCBO operations and events occurring at 400 feet AGL and below in Class G airspace do not require FAA review, approval or authorization. CBO's intending to conduct events in Class G airspace that may exceed 400 feet AGL must contact the FAA for further information."

Public aircraft are  aircraft owned and operated by the government of a state, the District of Columbia, or a territory or possession of the United States, or a political subdivision of one of these governments, except as provided in 49 USC 40125(b), Qualifications for Public Aircraft Status. Public aircraft can also be aircraft exclusively leased for at least 90 continuous days by the government of a state, the District of Columbia, or a territory or possession of the United States or a political subdivision of one of these governments, except as provided in 49 USC 40125(b), Qualifications for Public Aircraft Status.\n\nNOTE-\nThe term \u201cgovernment function\u201d refers to one of several activities undertaken by a government, such as national defense, intelligence missions, firefighting, search and rescue, law enforcement (including transportation of prisoners, detainees, and illegal aliens), aeronautical research, or biological or geopolitical resource management.An operation \u201cfor the public good\u201d does not necessarily meet the qualifications for a public operation; for example, most volunteer fire departments in the United States will not qualify as PAOs.Public safety organizations often conduct operations under 14 CFR Part 107, as well as public aircraft operations.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\n49 USC 40102, Definitions.\n49 USC 40125, Qualifications for Pubic Aircraft Status.\n\n\n\nA PAO is conducted under certain 14 CFR Part 91, UAS Operations Rules, with a COA granted to allow access to the NAS. A PAO COA allows blanket UAS operations in Class G airspace throughout the entire continental United States, including operations at night with appropriate lighting and training, for the duration of the COA. Waivers and/or authorizations to the COA can permit operations beyond the basic COA. Operating as a PAO requires adherence to specific conditions as directed in the COA. Operations under the public aircraft statute cannot include purposes that are not governmental functions. For example, a police UAS flying without remuneration to obtain footage for a department promotional video would not be a governmental function.\n\nCOA Application Process:\n\nPublic Declaration Letter (PDL). The first step in getting a PAO COA is to be recognized as an authorized government agency by submitting a PDL that shows the organization is indeed a governmental entity as defined by federal law. FAA general counsel reviews this letter, which is usually issued by a city, county, or state attorney Federal agencies are deemed to be governmental entities without submitting a PDL.\n\n\nCOA Request. If formally recognized as a governmental entity under federal law, entities are given access to the COA Application Process System (CAPS) or DroneZone, where a request for a PAO COA may be submitted. Operating as a PAO requires you to adhere to specific conditions as directed in your COA. Remember that an aircraft described in subparagraph (a), (b), (c), or (d) of 49 USC 40102(a)(41), Definitions, does not qualify as a public aircraft under such section when the aircraft is used for commercial purposes (e.g., performing a non-governmental function).\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAC 00-1.1, Public Aircraft Operations\u2014Manned and Unmanned.\n49 USC 40102, Definitions."

                "section-content": "Background:\n\nRemote identification (RID) of UAS is crucial to UAS integration.\n\n\nRID is the ability of a UAS in flight to provide identification and location information that can be received by other parties.\n\nRID allows the FAA, national security agencies, law enforcement, and others to distinguish compliant airspace users from those potentially posing a safety or security risk. It helps these agencies find the control station when a UAS appears to be flying unsafely or where it is prohibited.\n\n\nRemote ID Rule:\n\n14 CFR Part 89, Remote Identification (RID) of Unmanned Aircraft, will require most drones operating in U.S. airspace to have RID capability. UAS not equipped with RID capability will be limited to operating in specific FAA-approved geographic locations, such as FRIA.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\n14 CFR Part 89, Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft.\n\n\n\nThere are three ways drone pilots will be able to meet the identification requirements of the RID rule: Standard RID, RID Broadcast Module, and FRIAs.\n\nStandard RID. Only standard RID drones may be manufactured after the September 16, 2022, rule effective date. Unmanned aircraft broadcast the RID message elements directly from the unmanned aircraft from takeoff to shutdown. Message elements include: (1) A unique identifier to establish the identity of the unmanned aircraft; (2) an indication of the unmanned aircraft latitude, longitude, geometric altitude, and velocity; (3) an indication of the control station latitude, longitude, and geometric altitude; (4) a time mark; and (5) an emergency status indication. Operators may choose whether to use the serial number of the unmanned aircraft or a session ID (e.g., an alternative form of identification that provides additional privacy to the operator) as the unique identifier.\n\n\nRID Broadcast Modules. An unmanned aircraft can be equipped with a Remote ID broadcast module that broadcasts message elements from takeoff to shutdown. Message elements include: (1) The serial number of the broadcast module assigned by the producer; (2) an indication of the latitude, longitude, geometric altitude, and velocity of the unmanned aircraft; (3) an indication of the latitude, longitude, and geometric altitude of the unmanned aircraft takeoff location; and (4) a time mark.\n\nFAA-Recognized Identification Area:\n\nAn FAA-recognized identification area (FRIA) is a defined geographic area where persons can operate UAS without remote identification, provided they maintain visual line of sight. Organizations eligible to request establishment of a FRIA include CBOs recognized by the FAA and educational institutions. The latter group includes primary and secondary educational institutions, trade schools, colleges, and universities.\n\n\nTo operate in a FRIA according to the 14 CFR Part 89, RID of unmanned aircraft, operators must be physically located within the boundaries of the FRIA, must only operate drones within those boundaries, and must operate within VLOS at all times. UAS equipped with RID broadcast capability must broadcast continuously even while operating within or transiting a FRIA.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\n14 CFR Part 89, Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft.\n\n\nFIG 11-4-1 illustrates the three ways UAS operators can comply with the new RID rule.\nFIG 11-4-1RID Paths to Compliance"

                "section-content": "General. The NAS extends from the ground to above 60,000 feet MSL and includes various classifications of airspace, both uncontrolled and controlled. sUAS remote pilots and recreational flyers are generally permitted access to uncontrolled airspace without special permission. However, this changes when access to controlled airspace is desired. All access to controlled airspace whether by manned or unmanned aircraft must be granted by ATC.\n\nNOTE-\nWhile the NAS is divided into controlled and uncontrolled airspace, users must remember that all airspace is regulated, and certain rules apply throughout the NAS.Recreational flyers are limited to 400 feet AGL in Class G airspace, without special authorization.\n\n\nControlled airspace is a generic term that covers the different classification of airspace (Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, and Class E airspace) and defined dimensions within which air traffic control services can be provided to Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flights and to Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flights, in accordance with the airspace classification.\n\nSpecial Use Airspace (SUA). SUA consists of that airspace wherein flight activities must be confined because of their nature, or wherein limitations are imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities, or both. These areas are generally depicted on aeronautical charts and will be indicated on the B4UFly and LAANC applications for UAS.\n\nTemporary Flight Restrictions:\n\nTemporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) are non-permanent airspace restrictions created to protect persons and property in the air or on the surface from an existing or imminent hazard associated with an incident on the surface, when the presence of low flying aircraft would magnify, alter, spread, or compound that hazard (14 CFR Section 91.137(a)(1)). TFRs can exist to protect aircraft from hazards, and also to protect people/objects on the ground from aircraft hazards. Examples of TFRs include natural disaster areas especially forest fires, floods, congested flight areas, the area around spacecraft launches and recoveries, certain stadium sporting events, and the security of national public figures.\n\n\nUAS operators should be aware that substantial fines and penalties can be levied on UAS remote pilots or recreational flyers violating a TFR.\n\nSpecial Restrictions over Critical Infrastructure:\n\nOperating a UAS over our nation's critical infrastructure such as power grids, nuclear reactors, transportation centers, political or military sites, etc., can potentially create risk to people on the ground and also to fixed site facilities and associated infrastructure. To address security concerns, Public Law 114-190 and 115-254 mandated a process that would allow applicants to petition the FAA for restrictions from unmanned aircraft overflying their property.\n\n\nSpecial Security Instructions under 14 CFR Section 99.7 of the public laws allow the FAA to prohibit the operation of aircraft in certain airspace, in the interest of national security. The 14 CFR Section 99.7 interim solution prohibits UAS over approved fixed site facilities and limits the fixed site facilities to Federal owned sites UAS operations may be approved under the SGI process.\n\nUAS remote pilots and recreational flyers must carefully consider the need to fly over critical infrastructure and determine the legality of doing so, infractions may result in significant fines and legal actions.\n\nNOTE-\nFor a list of critical infrastructure sites, see https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nPublic Law 114-190, FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016.\nPublic Law 115-254, FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018.\n14 CFR Section 99.7, Special Security Instructions.\n\n\nSpecial Flight Rules Area (SFRA). SFRAs are airspaces of defined dimensions, above land areas or territorial waters, within which the flight of aircraft is subject to special rules, established after the September 11, 2001, attacks. Examples include the Washington, DC, Los Angeles, and Hudson River SFRAs. All aircraft are highly regulated within SFRAs. The inner area of some SFRAs, the Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ) is very highly restricted and prohibits all but previously vetted aircrew and aircraft from entering. Refer to VFR Sectional Charts or the FAA's Restricted Airspace website for information on specific airspace limitations and instructions for requesting entry.\n\nNOTE-\nThe FAA's Restricted Airspace website may be viewed at: https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/restricted-airspace-0.\n\nThere can be certain local restrictions to airspace. While the FAA is designated by federal law to be the regulator of the NAS, some state and local authorities may also restrict access to local airspace. UAS pilots should be aware of these local rules.\n\nOther Restrictions & Provisions:\n\nFlight over or near natural habitat or nature preserves. See paragraph 11-8-6, Environmental Best Practices, for a discussion of UAS flight restrictions over or near wildlife.\n\n\nNo Drone Zones is an FAA concept and outreach to promote safe and responsible use of UAS. The effort assists landowners (private and public) with designating their land off-limits for UAS take-offs and landings. The idea behind the outreach is to allow landowners who wish to avoid interactions on their property with UAS to state this preference in advance of UAS take-offs or landings. No Drone Zones do not apply to airspace. Generally speaking, for a No Drone Zone in a public place to be legally enforceable, there must exist underlying authority (ordinance, law, etc.). If the property in question is privately owned, the landowner's right to designate no UAS use is enforceable through trespass law.\n\nFlight over or near people and manned aircraft. In general, UAS remote pilots and recreational flyers should avoid flying over or near people or manned aircraft operations, and in any manner that could be construed as reckless or dangerous. See paragraph 11-8-3, Precautions: Flight Over or Near People, Manned Aircraft, and Night Flight, for specific information on flight over or near people.\n\nCorrectional Institutions. Flight over some federal prisons is restricted under 14 CFR Section 99.7, Special Security Instructions. Flight near other correctional institutions may be prohibited by other federal, state or local statutes. Subparagraph 11-4-6e, Special Restrictions over Critical Infrastructure, contains additional information regarding restrictions over critical infrastructure.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\n14 CFR Section 99.7, Special Security Instructions."

UTM is predicated on layers of information sharing and data exchange amongst a range of stakeholders including UAS operators, service providers, and the FAA to achieve safe operations. Operators share their flight intent with each other and coordinate to de-conflict and safely separate trajectories. The primary means of communication and coordination between operators, the FAA, and other stakeholders is through a distributed information network, rather than between pilots and air traffic controllers via traditional voice communications. The FAA makes real-time airspace constraints available to UAS operators, who are responsible for managing their own operations safely within these constraints without receiving ATC services from the FAA. However, the FAA does have access to applicable UTM operational information as necessary.\n\n\nUAS operators not receiving ATC separation services are required to participate in UTM at some level using applicable services to meet the performance requirements of their operations.

                "section-content": "Prior to every flight, pilots should gather all information vital to the nature of the flight, assess whether the flight would be safe, and then file a flight plan. Pilots can receive a regulatory compliant briefing without contacting Flight Service. Pilots are encouraged to use automated resources and review Advisory Circular AC 91-92, Pilot's Guide to a Preflight Briefing, for more information. Pilots who prefer to contact Flight Service are encouraged to conduct a self-brief prior to calling. Conducting a self-brief before contacting Flight Service provides familiarity of meteorological and aeronautical conditions applicable to the route of flight and promotes a better understanding of weather information. Pilots may access Flight Service through www.1800wxbrief.com or by calling 1-800-WX-BRIEF. Flight planning applications are also available for conducting a self-briefing and filing flight plans.\n\nNOTE-\nAlaska only: Pilots filing flight plans via \u201cfast file\u201d who desire to have their briefing recorded, should include a statement at the end of the recording as to the source of their weather briefing.\n\n\nThe information required by the FAA to process flight plans is obtained from FAA Form 7233-4, International Flight Plan. Only DoD users, and civilians who file stereo route flight plans, may use FAA Form 7233-1, Flight Plan.\n\nNOTE-\nFAA and DoD Flight Plan Forms are equivalent. Where the FAA specifies Form 7233-1, Flight Plan and FAA Form 7233-4, International Flight Plan, the DoD may substitute their Form DD 175, Military Flight Plan and Form DD-1801, DoD International Flight Plan as necessary. NAS automation systems process and convert data in the same manner, although for computer acceptance, input fields may be adjusted to follow FAA format.\n\nFSSs are required to advise of pertinent NOTAMs if a standard briefing is requested, but if they are overlooked, do not hesitate to remind the specialist that you have not received NOTAM information. Additionally, FSS briefers do not provide FDC NOTAM information for special instrument approach procedures unless specifically asked. Pilots authorized by the FAA to use special instrument approach procedures must specifically request FDC NOTAM information for these procedures. Pilots who receive the information electronically will receive NOTAMs for special IAPs automatically.\n\nNOTE-\nDomestic Notices and International Notices are not provided during a briefing unless specifically requested by the pilot since the FSS specialist has no way of knowing whether the pilot has already checked the Federal NOTAM System (FNS) NOTAM Search website external links prior to calling. Airway NOTAMs, procedural NOTAMs, and NOTAMs that are general in nature and not tied to a specific airport/facility (for example, flight advisories and restrictions, open duration special security instructions, and special flight rules areas) are briefed solely by pilot request. Remember to ask for these notices if you have not already reviewed this information, and to request all pertinent NOTAMs specific to your flight.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-1-3, Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) System.\n\n\nPilots are urged to use only the latest issue of aeronautical charts in planning and conducting flight operations. Aeronautical charts are revised and reissued on a regular scheduled basis to ensure that depicted data are current and reliable. In the conterminous U.S., Sectional Charts are updated every 6 months, IFR En Route Charts every 56 days, and amendments to civil IFR Approach Charts are accomplished on a 56-day cycle with a change notice volume issued on the 28-day midcycle. Charts that have been superseded by those of a more recent date may contain obsolete or incomplete flight information.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 9-1-4, General Description of Each Chart Series.\n\n\nWhen requesting a preflight briefing, identify yourself as a pilot and provide the following:\n\nType of flight planned; e.g., VFR or IFR.\n\n\nAircraft's number or pilot's name.\n\nAircraft type.\n\nDeparture Airport.\n\nRoute of flight.\n\nDestination.\n\nFlight altitude(s).\n\nETD and ETE.\n\nPrior to conducting a briefing, briefers are required to have the background information listed above so that they may tailor the briefing to the needs of the proposed flight. The objective is to communicate a \u201cpicture\u201d of meteorological and aeronautical information necessary for the conduct of a safe and efficient flight. Briefers use all available weather and aeronautical information to summarize data applicable to the proposed flight. Pilots who have briefed themselves before calling Flight Service should advise the briefer what information has been obtained from other sources.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 7-1-5, Preflight Briefings, \u2009contains those items of a weather briefing that should be expected or requested.\n\n\nFAA by 14 CFR Part 93, Subpart K, has designated High Density Traffic Airports (HDTA) and has prescribed air traffic rules and requirements for operating aircraft (excluding helicopter operations) to and from these airports.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nChart Supplement, Special Notices Section.\nAIM, Para\u20094-1-21, Airport Reservation Operations and Special Traffic Management Programs.\n\n\nIn addition to the filing of a flight plan, if the flight will traverse or land in one or more foreign countries, it is particularly important that pilots leave a complete itinerary with someone directly concerned and keep that person advised of the flight's progress. If serious doubt arises as to the safety of the flight, that person should first contact the FSS.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-1-11, Flights Outside the U.S. and U.S. Territories.\n\n\nPilots operating under provisions of 14 CFR Part\u2009135 on a domestic flight without having an FAA assigned 3-letter designator, must prefix the normal registration (N) number with the letter \u201cT\u201d on flight plan filing; for example, TN1234B.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 4-2-4, Aircraft Call Signs.\nFAA Order JO 7110.65, Para 2-3-5, Aircraft Identity, Subpara a.\nFAA Order JO 7110.10, Appendix B, FAA Form 7233-1, Flight Plan"

                "section-content": "To maintain IFR proficiency, pilots are urged to practice IFR procedures whenever possible, even when operating VFR. Some suggested practices include:\n\nObtain a complete preflight briefing and check NOTAMs. Prior to every flight, pilots should gather all information vital to the nature of the flight. Pilots can receive a regulatory compliant briefing without contacting Flight Service. Pilots are encouraged to use automated resources and review AC 91-92, Pilot's Guide to a Preflight Briefing, for more information. NOTAMs are available online from the Federal NOTAM System (FNS) NOTAM Search website ( https://notams.aim.faa.gov/notamSearch/ ), private vendors, or on request from Flight Service.\n\n\nFile a flight plan. This is an excellent low cost insurance policy. The cost is the time it takes to fill it out. The insurance includes the knowledge that someone will be looking for you if you become overdue at your destination. Pilots can file flight plans either by using a website or by calling Flight Service. Flight planning applications are also available to file, activate, and close VFR flight plans.\n\nUse current charts.\n\nUse the navigation aids. Practice maintaining a good course-keep the needle centered.\n\nMaintain a constant altitude which is appropriate for the direction of flight.\n\nEstimate en route position times.\n\nMake accurate and frequent position reports to the FSSs along your route of flight.\n\n\nSimulated IFR flight is recommended (under the hood); however, pilots are cautioned to review and adhere to the requirements specified in 14 CFR Section\u200991.109 before and during such flight.\n\nWhen flying VFR at night, in addition to the altitude appropriate for the direction of flight, pilots should maintain an altitude which is at or above the minimum en route altitude as shown on charts. This is especially true in mountainous terrain, where there is usually very little ground reference. Do not depend on your eyes alone to avoid rising unlighted terrain, or even lighted obstructions such as TV towers."

                "subpage-title": "Section 1. Preflight",
                "section-title": "Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) System",
                "section-content": "General. The NOTAM system provides pilots with time critical aeronautical information that is temporary, or information to be published on aeronautical charts at a later date, or information from another operational publication. The NOTAM is cancelled when the information in the NOTAM is published on the chart or when the temporary condition is returned to normal status. NOTAMs may be disseminated up to 7 days before the start of activity. Pilots can access NOTAM information online via NOTAM Search at: https://notams.aim.faa.gov/notamSearch/ or from an FSS.\n\n\nPreflight. 14 CFR \u00a7 91.103, Preflight Action directs pilots to become familiar with all available information concerning a planned flight prior to departure, including NOTAMs. Pilots may change their flight plan based on available information. Current NOTAM information may affect:\n\nAerodromes.\n\n\nRunways, taxiways, and ramp restrictions.\n\nObstructions.\n\nCommunications.\n\nAirspace.\n\nStatus of navigational aids or radar service availability.\n\nOther information essential to planned en route, terminal, or landing operations.\n\nARTCC NOTAMs. Pilots should also review NOTAMs for the ARTCC area (for example, Washington Center (ZDC),  Cleveland Center (ZOB), etc.) in which the flight will be operating. You can find the 3 letter code for each ARTCC on the FAA's NOTAM webpage. These NOTAMs may affect the planned flight. Some of the operations include Central Altitude Reservation Function (CARF), Special Use Airspace (SUA), Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR), Global Positioning System (GPS), Flight Data Center (FDC) changes to routes, wind turbine, and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS).\n\nNOTE-\nNOTAM information is transmitted using ICAO contractions to reduce transmission time. See TBL 5-1-2 for a listing of the most commonly used contractions, or go online to the following URL:\nhttps://www.notams.faa.gov/downloads/contractions.pdf. For a complete listing of approved NOTAM Contractions, see FAA JO Order 7340.2, Contractions.\n\nDestination Update. Pilots should also contact ATC or FSS while en route to obtain updated airfield information for their destination. This is particularly important when flying to the airports without an operating control tower. Snow removal, fire and rescue activities, construction, and wildlife encroachment, may pose hazards to pilots. This information may not be available to pilots prior to arrival/departure.\n\nNAVAID NOTAMs. Pilots should check NOTAMs to ensure NAVAIDs required for the flight are in service. A NOTAM is published when a NAVAID is out of service or Unserviceable (U/S). Although a NAVAID is deemed U/S and planned for removal from service, it may be a long time before that NAVAID is officially decommissioned and removed from charts. A NOTAM is the primary method of alerting pilots to its unavailability. It is recommended that pilots using VFR charts should regularly consult the Chart Update Bulletin. This bulletin identifies any updates to the chart that have not yet been accounted for.\n\nGPS NOTAMs. The FAA issues information on the status of GPS through the NOTAM system. Operators may find information on GPS satellite outages, GPS testing, and GPS anomalies by specifically searching for GPS NOTAMS prior to flight.\n\nThe NOTAM system uses the terms UNRELIABLE (UNREL), MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE (AVBL), and NOT AVAILABLE (AVBL) when describing the status of GPS. UNREL indicates the expected level of service of the GPS and/or WAAS may not be available. Pilots must then determine the adequacy of the signal for desired use. Aircraft should have additional navigation equipment for their intended route.\n\nNOTE-\nUnless associated with a known testing   NOTAM, pilots should report GPS anomalies, including degraded operation and/or loss of service, as soon as possible via radio or telephone, and via the GPS Anomaly Reporting Form. (See 1-1-13.)\n\n\nGPS operations may also be NOTAMed for testing. This is indicated in the NOTAM language with the name of the test in parenthesis. When GPS testing NOTAMS are published and testing is actually occurring, ATC will advise pilots requesting or cleared for a GPS or RNAV (GPS) approach, that GPS may not be available and request the pilot's intentions. TBL 5-1-1 lists an example of a GPS testing NOTAM.\n\nNOTAM Classification. NOTAM information is classified as Domestic NOTAMs (NOTAM D), Flight Data Center (FDC) NOTAMs, International NOTAMs, or Military NOTAMs.\n\nNOTAM (D) information is disseminated for all navigational facilities that are part of the National Airspace System (NAS), all public use aerodromes, seaplane bases, and heliports listed in the Chart Supplement. NOTAM (D) information includes taxiway closures, personnel and equipment near or crossing runways, and airport lighting aids that do not affect instrument approach criteria (i.e., VGSI). All NOTAM Ds must have one of the keywords listed in TBL 5-1-1, as the first part of the text after the location identifier. These keywords categorize NOTAM Ds by subject, for example, APRON (ramp), RWY (runway), SVC (Services), etc. There are several types of NOTAM Ds:\n\nAerodrome activity and conditions, to include field conditions.\n\n\nAirspace to include CARF, SUA, and general airspace activity like UAS or pyrotechnics.\n\nVisual and radio navigational aids.\n\nCommunication and services.\n\nPointer NOTAMs. NOTAMs issued to point to additional aeronautical information. When pointing to another NOTAM, the keyword in the pointer NOTAM must match the keyword in the original NOTAM. Pointer NOTAMs should be issued for, but are not limited to, TFRs, Airshows, Temporary SUA, major NAS system interruptions, etc.\n\n\nFDC NOTAMs are issued when it is necessary to disseminate regulatory information. FDC NOTAMs include:\n\nAmendments to published IAPs and other current aeronautical charts.\n\n\nTemporary Flight Restrictions (TFR) restrict entrance to a certain airspace at a certain time, however, some TFRs provide relief if ATC permission is given to enter the area when requested. Online preflight resources for TFRs provide graphics and plain language interpretations.\n\nHigh barometric pressure warning.\n\nLaser light activity.\n\nADS-B, TIS-B, and FIS-B service availability.\n\nSatellite-based systems such as WAAS or GPS.\n\nSpecial Notices.\n\nInternational NOTAMs are published in ICAO format per Annex 15 and distributed to multiple countries.\n\nInternational NOTAMs issued by the U.S. NOTAM Office use Series A followed by 4 sequential numbers, a slant \u201c/\u201d and a 2-digit number representing the year the NOTAM was issued. International NOTAMs basically duplicate data found in a U.S. Domestic NOTAM.\n\n\nNot every topic of a U.S. Domestic NOTAM is issued as an International NOTAM by the U.S. The U.S. International NOTAM will be linked to the appropriate U.S. Domestic NOTAM when possible.\n\nInternational NOTAMs received by the FAA from other countries are stored in the U.S. NOTAM System.\n\nThe International NOTAM format includes a \u201cQ\u201d Line that can be easily read/parsed by a computer and allows the NOTAM to be displayed digitally.\n\nField A:\u00a0 ICAO location identifier or FIR affected by the NOTAM.\n\n\nField B: Start of Validity.\n\nField C: End of Validity (both in [Year][Month][Day][Hour][Minute] format).\n\nField D: (when present) Schedule.\n\nField E: Full NOTAM description.\n\nField F: (when present) Lowest altitude, or \u201cSFC.\u201d\n\nField G: (when present) Highest altitude, or \u201cUNL.\u201d\n\nFor more on International format, please see Annex 15.\n\nMilitary NOTAMs are NOTAMs originated by the U.S. Air Force, Army, Marine, or Navy, and pertaining to military or joint-use navigational aids/airports that are part of the NAS. Military NOTAMs are published in the International NOTAM format and should be reviewed by users of a military or joint-use facility.\n\nSecurity NOTAMS:\n\nU.S. Domestic Security NOTAMS are FDC NOTAMS that inform pilots of certain U.S. security activities or requirements, such as Special Security Instructions for aircraft operations to, from, within, or transitioning U.S. territorial airspace. These NOTAMS are found on the Federal NOTAM System (FNS) NOTAM Search website under the location designator KZZZ.\n\n\nUnited States International Flight Prohibitions, Potential Hostile Situations, and Foreign Notices are issued by the FAA and are found on the Federal NOTAM System (FNS) NOTAM Search website under the location designator KICZ.\nTBL 5-1-1NOTAM Keywords\n\n\n\nKeyword\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nRWYExample\n\n\nRunway\n!BNA BNA RWY 18/36 CLSD YYMMDDHHMM-YYMMDDHHMM\n\n\n\n\nTWYExample\n\n\nTaxiway\n!BTV BTV TWY C EDGE LGT OBSC YYMMDDHHMM-YYMMDDHHMM\n\n\n\n\nAPRONExample\n\n\nApron/Ramp\n!BNA BNA APRON NORTH APN E 100FT CLSD YYMMDDHHMM-YYMMDDHHMM\n\n\n\n\nADExample\n\n\nAerodrome\n!BET BET AD AP ELK NEAR MOVEMENT AREAS YYMMDDHHMM-YYMMDDHHMM\n\n\n\n\nOBSTExample\n\n\nObstruction\n!SJT SJT OBST MOORED BALLOON WI AN AREA DEFINED AS 1NM RADIUS OF SJT 2430FT (510FT AGL) FLAGGED YYMMDDHHMM-YYMMDDHHMM\n\n\n\n\nNAVExample\n\n\nNavigation Aids\n!SHV SHV NAV ILS RWY 32 110.3 COMMISSIONED YYMMDDHHMM-PERM\n\n\n\n\nCOMExample\n\n\nCommunications\n!INW INW COM REMOTE COM OUTLET 122.6 U/S YYMMDDHHMM-YYMMDDHHMM EST  \n(Note* EST will auto cancel)\n\n\n\n\nSVCExample\n\n\nServices\n!ROA ROA SVC TWR COMMISSIONED YYMMDDHHMM-PERM\n\n\n\n\nAIRSPACEExample\n\n\nAirspace\n!MHV MHV AIRSPACE AEROBATIC ACFT WI AN AREA DEFINED AS 4.3NM RADIUS OF MHV 5500FT-10500FT AVOIDANCE ADZ CTC JOSHUA APP DLY YYMMDDHHMM-YYMMDDHHMM\n\n\n\n\nODPExample\n\n\nObstacle Departure Procedure\n!FDC 2/9700 DIK ODP DICKINSON - THEODORE ROOSEVELT RGNL, DICKINSON, ND.

NAS operators are encouraged to access the website at http://www.fly.faa.gov prior to filing their flight plan.\n\n\nThe website consolidates information from advisories. An advisory is a message that is disseminated electronically by the ATCSCC that contains information pertinent to the NAS.\n\nAdvisories are normally issued for the following items:\n\nGround Stops.\n\n\nGround Delay Programs.\n\nRoute Information.\n\nPlan of Operations.\n\nFacility Outages and Scheduled Facility Outages.\n\nVolcanic Ash Activity Bulletins.\n\nSpecial Traffic Management Programs.\n\n\nThis list is not all-inclusive. Any time there is information that may be beneficial to a large number of people, an advisory may be sent. Additionally, there may be times when an advisory is not sent due to workload or the short length of time of the activity.\n\nRoute information is available on the website and in specific advisories. Some route information, subject to the 56-day publishing cycle, is located on the \u201cOIS\u201d under \u201cProducts,\u201d Route Management Tool (RMT), and \u201cWhat's New\u201d Playbook. The RMT and Playbook contain routings for use by Air Traffic and NAS operators when they are coordinated \u201creal-time\u201d and are then published in an ATCSCC advisory.\n\nRoute advisories are identified by the word \u201cRoute\u201d in the header; the associated action is required (RQD), recommended (RMD), planned (PLN), or for your information (FYI). Operators are expected to file flight plans consistent with the Route RQD advisories.\n\nElectronic System Impact Reports are on the intranet at http://www.atcscc.faa.gov/ois/ under \u201cSystem Impact Reports.\" This page lists scheduled outages/events/projects that significantly impact the\u2009NAS; for example, runway closures, air shows, and construction projects.

                "section-content": "The requirements for the filing and activation of VFR flight plans can vary depending in which airspace the flight is operating. Pilots are responsible for activating flight plans with a Flight Service Station. Control tower personnel do not automatically activate VFR flight plans.\n\nWithin the continental U.S., a VFR flight plan is not normally required.\n\n\nVFR flights (except for DoD and law enforcement flights) into an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) are required to file DVFR flight plans.\n\nNOTE-\nDetailed ADIZ procedures are found inSection 6, National Security and Interception Procedures, of this chapter. (See 14 CFR Part 99).\n\nFlights within the Washington, DC Special Flight Rules Area have additional requirements that must be met. Visit http://www.faasafety.gov for the required Special Awareness Training that must be completed before flight within this area.\n\nVFR flight to an international destination requires a filed and activated flight plan.\n\nNOTE-\nICAO flight plan guidance is published in ICAO Document 4444 PANS-ATM Appendix 2.\n\n\nIt is strongly recommended that a VFR flight plan be filed with a Flight Service Station or equivalent flight plan filing service. When filing, pilots must use FAA Form 7233-4, International Flight Plan or DD Form 1801. Only DoD users,  and civilians who file stereo route flight plans, may use FAA Form 7233-1, Flight Plan. Pilots may take advantage of advances in technology by filing their flight plans using any available electronic means. Activating the flight plan will ensure that you receive VFR Search and Rescue services.\n\nWhen a stopover flight is anticipated, it is recommended that a separate flight plan be filed for each leg of the flight.\n\nPilots are encouraged to activate their VFR flight plans with Flight Service by the most expeditious means possible. This may be via radio or other electronic means. VFR flight plan proposals are normally retained for two hours following the proposed time of departure.\n\nPilots may also activate a VFR flight plan by using an assumed departure time. This assumed departure time will cause the flight plan to become active at the designated time. This may negate the need for communication with a flight service station or flight plan filing service upon departure. It is the pilot's responsibility to revise his actual departure time, time en route, or ETA with flight service.\n\nNOTE-\nPilots are strongly advised to remain mindful when using an assumed departure time. If not updated, search and rescue activities will be based on the assumed departure time.\n\nU.S. air traffic control towers do not routinely activate VFR flight plans. Foreign pilots especially must be mindful of the need to communicate directly with a flight service station, or use an assumed departure time procedure clearly communicated with the flight plan filing service.\n\nAlthough position reports are not required for VFR flight plans, periodic reports to FSSs along the route are good practice. Such contacts permit significant information to be passed to the transiting aircraft and also serve to check the progress of the flight should it be necessary for any reason to locate the aircraft.\n\nPilots flying VFR should fly an appropriate cruising altitude for their direction of flight.\n\nWhen filing a VFR Flight plan, indicate the appropriate aircraft equipment capability as prescribed for an IFR flight plan.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-1-6, IFR Flights.\n\n\nATC radar history data can be useful in finding a downed or missing aircraft; therefore, surveillance equipment should be listed in Item 18. Pilots using commercial GPS tracking services are encouraged to note the specific service in Item 19 N/ (survival equip remarks) of FAA Form 7233-4 or DD Form 1801."

                "section-title": "Flight Plan - IFR Flights",
                "section-content": "General\n\nUse of FAA Form 7233-4 or DD Form 1801 is mandatory for:\n\nAssignment of RNAV SIDs and STARs or other PBN routing,\n\n\nAll civilian IFR flights that will depart U.S. domestic airspace, and\n\nDomestic IFR flights except military/DoD and civilians who file stereo route flight plans.\n\nAll military/DoD IFR flights that will depart U.S. controlled airspace.\n\n\nMilitary/DoD flights using FAA Form 7233-1, or DD Form 175, may not be eligible for assignment of RNAV SIDs or STARs. Military flights desiring assignment of these procedures should file using FAA Form 7233-4 or DD 1801, as described in this section.\n\nWhen filing an IFR flight plan using FAA Form 7233-4 or DD Form 1801, it is recommended that filers include all operable navigation, communication, and surveillance equipment capabilities by adding appropriate equipment qualifiers as shown in Appendix 4, FAA Form 7233-4, International Flight Plan.\n\nATC issues clearances based on aircraft capabilities filed in Items 10 and 18 of FAA Form 7233-4 or DD 1801. Operators should file all capabilities for which the aircraft and crew is certified, capable, and authorized. PBN/capability must be filed in Item 18, Other Information. When filing a capability, ATC expects filers to use that capability; for example, answer a SATVOICE call from ATC if code M1 or M3 is filed in Item 10a.\n\nPrior to departure from within, or prior to entering controlled airspace, a pilot must submit a complete flight plan and receive an air traffic clearance, if weather conditions are below VFR minimums. IFR flight plans may be submitted to an FSS or flight plan filing service.\n\nPilots should file IFR flight plans at least 30 minutes prior to estimated time of departure to preclude possible delay in receiving a departure clearance from ATC.\n\nIn order to provide FAA traffic management units' strategic route planning capabilities, nonscheduled operators conducting IFR operations above FL 230 are requested to voluntarily file IFR flight plans at least 4 hours prior to estimated time of departure (ETD).\n\nTo minimize your delay in entering Class B, Class C, Class D, and Class E surface areas at destination when IFR weather conditions exist or are forecast at that airport, an IFR flight plan should be filed before departure. Otherwise, a 30-minute delay is not unusual in receiving an ATC clearance because of time spent in processing flight plan data.\n\nTraffic saturation frequently prevents control personnel from accepting flight plans by radio. In such cases, the pilot is advised to contact a flight plan filing service for the purpose of filing the flight plan.\n\nWhen requesting an IFR clearance, it is highly recommended that the departure airport be identified by stating the city name and state and/or the airport location identifier in order to clarify to ATC the exact location of the intended airport of departure.\n\nMultiple versions of flight plans for the same flight may lead to unsafe conditions and errors within the air traffic system. Pilots must not file more than one flight plan for the same flight without ensuring that the previous flight plan has been successfully removed.\n\nWhen a pilot is aware that the possibility for multiple flight plans on the same aircraft may exist, ensuring receipt of a full route clearance will help mitigate chances of error.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-1-12, Change in Flight Plan.\nAIM, Para 5-1-13, Change in Proposed Departure Time.\n\n\n\nAirways and Jet Routes Depiction on Flight Plan\n\nIt is vitally important that the route of flight be accurately and completely described in the flight plan. To simplify definition of the proposed route, and to facilitate ATC, pilots are requested to file via airways or jet routes established for use at the altitude or flight level planned.\n\n\nIf flight is to be conducted via designated airways or jet routes, describe the route by indicating the type and number designators of the airway(s) or jet route(s) requested. If more than one airway or jet route is to be used, clearly indicate points of transition. If the transition is made at an unnamed intersection, show the next succeeding NAVAID or named intersection on the intended route and the complete route from that point. Reporting points may be identified by using authorized name/code as depicted on appropriate aeronautical charts. The following two examples illustrate the need to specify the transition point when two routes share more than one transition fix.\n\nEXAMPLE-ALB J37 BUMPY J14 BHM Spelled out:from Albany, New York, via Jet Route 37 transitioning to Jet Route 14 at BUMPY intersection, thence via Jet Route 14 to Birmingham, Alabama.ALB J37 ENO J14 BHM Spelled out:from Albany, New York, via Jet Route 37 transitioning to Jet Route 14 at Smyrna VORTAC (ENO) thence via Jet Route 14 to Birmingham, Alabama.\nThe route of flight may also be described by naming the reporting points or NAVAIDs over which the flight will pass, provided the points named are established for use at the altitude or flight level planned.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nBWI V44 SWANN V433 DQO Spelled out: from Baltimore-Washington International, via Victor 44 to Swann intersection, transitioning to Victor 433 at Swann, thence via Victor 433 to Dupont.\nWhen the route of flight is defined by named reporting points, whether alone or in combination with airways or jet routes, and the navigational aids (VOR, VORTAC, TACAN, NDB) to be used for the flight are a combination of different types of aids, enough information should be included to clearly indicate the route requested.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nLAX J5 LKV J3 GEG YXC FL 330 J500 VLR J515 YWG Spelled out: from Los Angeles International via Jet Route 5 Lakeview, Jet Route 3 Spokane, direct Cranbrook, British Columbia VOR/DME, Flight Level 330 Jet Route 500 to Langruth, Manitoba VORTAC, Jet Route 515 to Winnipeg, Manitoba.\nWhen filing IFR, it is to the pilot's advantage to file a preferred route.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nPreferred IFR Routes are described and tabulated in the Chart Supplement.\nAdditionally available at U.S.\nhttp://www.fly.faa.gov/Products/Coded_Departure_Routes/NFDC_Preferred_Routes_Database/nfdc_preferred_routes_database.html.\n\n\nATC may issue a SID or a STAR, as appropriate.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-2-9, Instrument Departure Procedures (DP) - Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP) and Standard Instrument Departures (SID), and Diverse Vector Areas (DVA).\nAIM, Para 5-4-1, Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) Procedures.\n\n\nNOTE-\nPilots not desiring an RNAV SID or RNAV STAR should enter in Item #18, PBN code: NAV/RNV A0 and/or D0.\n\nDirect Flights\n\nAll or any portions of the route which will not be flown on the radials or courses of established airways or routes, such as direct route flights, must be defined by indicating the radio fixes over which the flight will pass. Fixes selected to define the route must be those over which the position of the aircraft can be accurately determined. Such fixes automatically become compulsory reporting points for the flight, unless advised otherwise by ATC. Only those navigational aids established for use in a particular structure; i.e., in the low or high structures, may be used to define the en route phase of a direct flight within that altitude structure.\n\n\nThe azimuth feature of VOR aids and the azimuth and distance (DME) features of VORTAC and TACAN aids are assigned certain frequency protected areas of airspace which are intended for application to established airway and route use, and to provide guidance for planning flights outside of established airways or routes. These areas of airspace are expressed in terms of cylindrical service volumes of specified dimensions called \u201cclass limits\u201d or \u201ccategories.\u201d\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 1-1-8, Navigational Aid (NAVAID) Service Volumes.\n\n\nAn operational service volume has been established for each class in which adequate signal coverage and frequency protection can be assured. To facilitate use of VOR, VORTAC, or TACAN aids, consistent with their operational service volume limits, pilot use of such aids for defining a direct route of flight in controlled airspace should not exceed the following:\n\nOperations above FL 450 - Use aids not more than 200 NM apart. These aids are depicted on en route high altitude charts.\n\n\nOperation off established routes from 18,000 feet MSL to FL 450 - Use aids not more than 260 NM apart. These aids are depicted on en route high altitude charts.\n\nOperation off established airways below 18,000 feet MSL - Use aids not more than 80 NM apart. These aids are depicted on en route low altitude charts.\n\nOperation off established airways between 14,500 feet MSL and 17,999 feet MSL in the conterminous U.S. - (H) facilities not more than 200 NM apart may be used.\n\nIncreasing use of self-contained airborne navigational systems which do not rely on the VOR/VORTAC/TACAN system has resulted in pilot requests for direct routes which exceed NAVAID service volume limits.\n\nAt times, ATC will initiate a direct route in a surveillance environment which exceeds NAVAID service volume limits. Pilots must adhere to the altitude specified in the clearance.\n\nAppropriate airway or jet route numbers may also be included to describe portions of the route to be flown.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nMDW V262 BDF V10 BRL STJ SLN GCK Spelled out: from Chicago Midway Airport via Victor 262 to Bradford, Victor 10 to Burlington, Iowa, direct St. Joseph, Missouri, direct Salina, Kansas, direct Garden City, Kansas.\nNOTE-\nWhen route of flight is described by radio fixes, the pilot will be expected to fly a direct course between the points named.\n\nPilots are reminded that they are responsible for adhering to obstruction clearance requirements on those segments of direct routes that are outside of controlled airspace and ATC surveillance capability.

For example, there are 3 high altitude airports in the U.S. with approved instrument approach procedures where all of the MDAs are greater than 2,000 feet and/or the landing visibility minimums are greater than 3 miles (Bishop, California; South Lake Tahoe, California; and Aspen-Pitkin Co./Sardy Field, Colorado). In the case of these airports, it is possible for a pilot to elect, on the basis of forecasts, not to carry sufficient fuel to get to an alternate when the ceiling and/or visibility is actually lower than that necessary to complete the approach.\n\n\nA small number of other airports in mountainous terrain have MDAs which are slightly (100 to 300 feet) below 2,000 feet AGL. In situations where there is an option as to whether to plan for an alternate, pilots should bear in mind that just a slight worsening of the weather conditions from those forecast could place the airport below the published IFR landing minimums.\n\nAn IFR flight to an airport which requires special equipment; i.e., DME, glide slope, etc., in order to make the available approaches to the lowest minimums. Pilots should be aware that all other minimums on the approach charts may require weather conditions better than those specified in 14\u2009CFR Section\u200991.167(b).

Every effort should be made to secure information on the location and range of navigational aids, availability of communications and meteorological services, the provision of air traffic services, including alerting service, and the existence of search and rescue services.\n\n\nPilots should remember that there is a need to continuously guard the VHF emergency frequency 121.5 MHz when on long over\u2010water flights, except when communications on other VHF channels, equipment limitations, or cockpit duties prevent simultaneous guarding of two channels. Guarding of 121.5 MHz is particularly critical when operating in proximity to Flight Information Region (FIR) boundaries, for example, operations on Route R220 between Anchorage and Tokyo, since it serves to facilitate communications with regard to aircraft which may experience in\u2010flight emergencies, communications, or navigational difficulties.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nICAO Annex 10, Vol II, Paras 5.2.2.1.1.1 and 5.2.2.1.1.2.\n\n\nThe filing of a flight plan, always good practice, takes on added significance for extended flights outside U.S. airspace and is, in fact, usually required by the laws of the countries being visited or overflown. It is also particularly important in the case of such flights that pilots leave a complete itinerary and schedule of the flight with someone directly concerned and keep that person advised of the flight's progress. If serious doubt arises as to the safety of the flight, that person should first contact the appropriate FSS. Round Robin Flight Plans to Canada and Mexico are not accepted.\n\nAll pilots should review the foreign airspace and entry restrictions published in the appropriate Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) during the flight planning process. Foreign airspace penetration without official authorization can involve both danger to the aircraft and the imposition of severe penalties and inconvenience to both passengers and crew. A flight plan on file with ATC authorities does not necessarily constitute the prior permission required by certain other authorities. The possibility of fatal consequences cannot be ignored in some areas of the world.\n\nCurrent NOTAMs for foreign locations must also be reviewed. International Notices regarding specific countries may be obtained through the Federal NOTAM System (FNS) NOTAM Search External Links or the Air Traffic Plans and Publications website. For additional flight information at foreign locations, pilots should also review the FAA's Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices website at https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/.\n\nWhen customs notification to foreign locations is required, it is the responsibility of the pilot to arrange for customs notification in a timely manner.\n\nAircraft arriving to locations in U.S. territorial airspace must meet the entry requirements as described in AIM Section 6, National Security and Interception Procedures."

This can be done after landing if there is a functioning FSS or other means of direct communications with ATC.

Flight crews should crosscheck the cleared flight plan against charts or other applicable resources, as well as the navigation system textual display and the aircraft map display. This process includes confirmation of the waypoints sequence, reasonableness of track angles and distances, any altitude or speed constraints, and identification of fly-by or fly-over waypoints. A procedure must not be used if validity of the navigation database is in doubt.\n\nPrior to commencing takeoff, the flight crew must verify that the RNAV system is operating correctly and the correct airport and runway data have been loaded.\n\nDuring the pre-flight planning phase RAIM prediction must be performed if TSO-C129() equipment is used to solely satisfy the RNAV and RNP requirement.

In the event of a predicted, continuous loss of RAIM of more than five (5) minutes for any part of the intended flight, the flight should be delayed, canceled, or re-routed where RAIM requirements can be met. Operators may satisfy the predictive RAIM requirement through any one of the following methods:\n\nOperators may monitor the status of each satellite in its plane/slot position, by accounting for the latest GPS constellation status (for example, NOTAMs or NANUs), and compute RAIM availability using model-specific RAIM prediction software;\n\n\nOperators may use the Service Availability Prediction Tool (SAPT) on the FAA en route and terminal RAIM prediction website;\n\nOperators may contact a Flight Service Station to obtain non-precision approach RAIM;\n\nOperators may use a third party interface, incorporating FAA/VOLPE RAIM prediction data without altering performance values, to predict RAIM outages for the aircraft's predicted flight path and times;\n\nOperators may use the receiver's installed RAIM prediction capability (for TSO-C129a/Class A1/B1/C1 equipment) to provide non-precision approach RAIM, accounting for the latest GPS constellation status (for example, NOTAMs or NANUs).

The 406 MHz ELTs also transmits a stronger signal when activated than the older 121.5 MHz ELTs.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires 406 MHz ELTs be registered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as outlined in the ELTs documentation. The FAA's 406 MHz ELT Technical Standard Order (TSO) TSO-C126 also requires that each 406 MHz ELT be registered with NOAA. The reason is NOAA maintains the owner registration database for U.S. registered 406 MHz alerting devices, which includes ELTs. NOAA also operates the United States' portion of the Cospas-Sarsat satellite distress alerting system designed to detect activated 406 MHz ELTs and other distress alerting devices.\n\n\nAs of 2009, the Cospas-Sarsat system terminated monitoring and reception of the 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz frequencies.  What this means for pilots is that those aircraft with only 121.5 MHz or 243.0 MHz ELTs onboard will have to depend upon either a nearby air traffic control facility receiving the alert signal or an overflying aircraft monitoring 121.5 MHz or 243.0 MHz detecting the alert and advising ATC.\n\nIn the event that a properly registered 406\u2009MHz ELT activates, the Cospas-Sarsat satellite system can decode the owner's information and provide that data to the appropriate search and rescue\u2009(SAR) center. In the United States, NOAA provides the alert data to the appropriate U.S. Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) or U.S. Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Center. That RCC can then telephone or contact the owner to verify the status of the aircraft. If the aircraft is safely secured in a hangar, a costly ground or airborne search is avoided. In the case of an inadvertent 406 MHz ELT activation, the owner can deactivate the 406 MHz ELT. If the 406 MHz ELT equipped aircraft is being flown, the RCC can quickly activate a search. 406\u2009MHz ELTs permit the Cospas-Sarsat satellite system to narrow the search area to a more confined area compared to that of a 121.5 MHz or 243.0 MHz ELT. 406 MHz ELTs also include a low-power 121.5\u2009MHz homing transmitter to aid searchers in finding the aircraft in the terminal search phase.\n\nEach analog ELT emits a distinctive downward swept audio tone on 121.5 MHz and 243.0\u2009MHz.\n\nIf \u201carmed\u201d and when subject to crash-generated forces, ELTs are designed to automatically activate and continuously emit their respective signals, analog or digital. The transmitters will operate continuously for at least 48 hours over a wide temperature range. A properly installed, maintained, and functioning ELT can expedite search and rescue operations and save lives if it survives the crash and is activated.\n\nPilots and their passengers should know how to activate the aircraft's ELT if manual activation is required. They should also be able to verify the aircraft's ELT is functioning and transmitting an alert after a crash or manual activation.\n\nBecause of the large number of 121.5 MHz ELT false alerts and the lack of a quick means of verifying the actual status of an activated 121.5 MHz or 243.0 MHz analog ELT through an owner registration database, U.S. SAR forces do not respond as quickly to initial 121.5/243.0 MHz ELT alerts as the SAR forces do to 406 MHz ELT alerts. Compared to the almost instantaneous detection of a 406 MHz ELT, SAR forces' normal practice is to wait for confirmation of an overdue aircraft or similar notification. In some cases, this confirmation process can take hours. SAR forces can initiate a response to 406 MHz alerts in minutes compared to the potential delay of hours for a 121.5/243.0 MHz ELT. Therefore, due to the obvious advantages of 406 MHz beacons and the significant disadvantages to the older 121.5/243.0 MHz beacons, and considering that the International Cospas-Sarsat Program stopped the monitoring of 121.5/243.0 MHz by satellites on February 1, 2009, all aircraft owners/operators are highly encouraged by both NOAA and the FAA to consider making the switch to a digital 406 MHz ELT beacon.  Further, for non-aircraft owner pilots, check the ELT installed in the aircraft you are flying, and as appropriate, obtain a personal locator beacon transmitting on 406 MHz.\n\n\nTesting.\n\nELTs should be tested in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, preferably in a shielded or screened room or specially designed test container to prevent the broadcast of signals which could trigger a false alert.\n\n\nWhen this cannot be done, aircraft operational testing is authorized as follows:\n\nAnalog 121.5/243 MHz ELTs should only be tested during the first 5 minutes after any hour. If operational tests must be made outside of this period, they should be coordinated with the nearest FAA Control Tower. Tests should be no longer than three audible sweeps. If the antenna is removable, a dummy load should be substituted during test procedures.\n\n\nDigital 406 MHz ELTs should only be tested in accordance with the unit's manufacturer's instructions.\n\nAirborne tests are not authorized.\n\nFalse Alarms.\n\nCaution should be exercised to prevent the inadvertent activation of ELTs in the air or while they are being handled on the ground. Accidental or unauthorized activation will generate an emergency signal that cannot be distinguished from the real thing, leading to expensive and frustrating searches. A false ELT signal could also interfere with genuine emergency transmissions and hinder or prevent the timely location of crash sites. Frequent false alarms could also result in complacency and decrease the vigorous reaction that must be attached to all ELT signals.\n\n\nNumerous cases of inadvertent activation have occurred as a result of aerobatics, hard landings, movement by ground crews and aircraft maintenance. These false alarms can be minimized by monitoring 121.5 MHz and/or 243.0 MHz as follows:\n\nIn flight when a receiver is available.\n\n\nBefore engine shut down at the end of each flight.\n\nWhen the ELT is handled during installation or maintenance.\n\nWhen maintenance is being performed near the ELT.\n\nWhen a ground crew moves the aircraft.\n\nIf an ELT signal is heard, turn off the aircraft's ELT to determine if it is transmitting. If it has been activated, maintenance might be required before the unit is returned to the \u201cARMED\u201d position. You should contact the nearest Air Traffic facility and notify it of the inadvertent activation.\n\nInflight Monitoring and Reporting.\n\nPilots are encouraged to monitor 121.5 MHz and/or 243.0 MHz while inflight to assist in identifying possible emergency ELT transmissions. On receiving a signal, report the following information to the nearest air traffic facility:\n\nYour position at the time the signal was first heard.\n\n\nYour position at the time the signal was last heard.\n\nYour position at maximum signal strength.\n\nYour flight altitudes and frequency on which the emergency signal was heard: 121.5 MHz or 243.0 MHz. If possible, positions should be given relative to a navigation aid. If the aircraft has homing equipment, provide the bearing to the emergency signal with each reported position."

SAR is a lifesaving service provided through the combined efforts of the federal agencies signatory to the National SAR Plan, and the agencies responsible for SAR within each state. Operational resources are provided by the U.S. Coast Guard, DoD components, the Civil Air Patrol, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, state, county and local law enforcement and other public safety agencies, and private volunteer organizations. Services include search for missing aircraft, survival aid, rescue, and emergency medical help for the occupants after an accident site is located.\n\n\nNational Search and Rescue Plan. By federal interagency agreement, the National Search and Rescue Plan provides for the effective use of all available facilities in all types of SAR missions. These facilities include aircraft, vessels, pararescue and ground rescue teams, and emergency radio fixing. Under the plan, the U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for the coordination of SAR in the Maritime Region, and the USAF is responsible in the Inland Region. To carry out these responsibilities, the Coast Guard and the Air Force have established Rescue Coordination Centers (RCCs) to direct SAR activities within their regions. For aircraft emergencies, distress, and urgency, information normally will be passed to the appropriate RCC through an ARTCC or FSS.\n\nCoast Guard Rescue Coordination Centers.

Pilots receiving VFR services from radar facilities should be aware that SAR may be initiated under these circumstances.\n\n\nA filed flight plan is the most timely and effective indicator that an aircraft is overdue. Flight plan information is invaluable to SAR forces for search planning and executing search efforts.\n\n\nPrior to departure on every flight, local or otherwise, someone at the departure point should be advised of your destination and route of flight if other than direct. Search efforts are often wasted and rescue is often delayed because of pilots who thoughtlessly takeoff without telling anyone where they are going. File a flight plan for your safety.\n\nAccording to the National Search and Rescue Plan, \u201cThe life expectancy of an injured survivor decreases as much as 80 percent during the first 24\u2009hours, while the chances of survival of uninjured survivors rapidly diminishes after the first 3 days.\u201d\n\nAn Air Force Review of 325 SAR missions conducted during a 23-month period revealed that \u201cTime works against people who experience a distress but are not on a flight plan, since 36 hours normally pass before family concern initiates an (alert).\u201d\n\nVFR Search and Rescue Protection.\n\nTo receive this valuable protection, file a VFR or DVFR Flight Plan with an FAA FSS. For maximum protection, file only to the point of first intended landing, and refile for each leg to final destination. When a lengthy flight plan is filed, with several stops en route and an ETE to final destination, a mishap could occur on any leg, and unless other information is received, it is probable that no one would start looking for you until 30 minutes after your ETA at your final destination.\n\n\nIf you land at a location other than the intended destination, report the landing to the nearest FAA FSS and advise them of your original destination.\n\nIf you land en route and are delayed more than 30 minutes, report this information to the nearest FSS and give them your original destination.\n\nIf your ETE changes by 30 minutes or more, report a new ETA to the nearest FSS and give them your original destination. Remember that if you fail to respond within one\u2010half hour after your ETA at final destination, a search will be started to locate you.\n\nIt is important that you close your flight plan IMMEDIATELY AFTER ARRIVAL AT YOUR FINAL DESTINATION WITH THE FSS DESIGNATED WHEN YOUR FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED. The pilot is responsible for closure of a VFR or DVFR flight plan; they are not closed automatically. This will prevent needless search efforts.\n\nThe rapidity of rescue on land or water will depend on how accurately your position may be determined. If a flight plan has been followed and your position is on course, rescue will be expedited.\n\nSurvival Equipment.\n\nFor flight over uninhabited land areas, it is wise to take and know how to use survival equipment for the type of climate and terrain.\n\n\nIf a forced landing occurs at sea, chances for survival are governed by the degree of crew proficiency in emergency procedures and by the availability and effectiveness of water survival equipment.\n\nBody Signal Illustrations.\n\nIf you are forced down and are able to attract the attention of the pilot of a rescue airplane, the body signals illustrated on these pages can be used to transmit messages to the pilot circling over your location.\n\n\nStand in the open when you make the signals.\n\nBe sure the background, as seen from the air, is not confusing.\n\nGo through the motions slowly and repeat each signal until you are positive that the pilot understands you.\n\nObservance of Downed Aircraft.\n\nDetermine if crash is marked with a yellow cross; if so, the crash has already been reported and identified.\n\n\nIf possible, determine type and number of aircraft and whether there is evidence of survivors.\n\nFix the position of the crash as accurately as possible with reference to a navigational aid. If possible, provide geographic or physical description of the area to aid ground search parties.\n\nTransmit the information to the nearest FAA or other appropriate radio facility.\n\nIf circumstances permit, orbit the scene to guide in other assisting units until their arrival or until you are relieved by another aircraft.\n\nImmediately after landing, make a complete report to the nearest FAA facility, or Air Force or Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Center. The report can be made by a long distance collect telephone call.\nFIG 6-2-1Ground-Air Visual Code for Use by Survivors\nFIG 6-2-2Ground-Air Visual Code for use by Ground Search Parties\nFIG 6-2-3Urgent Medical Assistance\nFIG 6-2-4All OK\nFIG 6-2-5Short Delay\nFIG 6-2-6Long Delay\nFIG 6-2-7Drop Message\nFIG 6-2-8Receiver Operates\nFIG 6-2-9Do Not Land Here\nFIG 6-2-10Land Here\nFIG 6-2-11Negative (Ground)\nFIG 6-2-12Affirmative (Ground)\nFIG 6-2-13Pick Us Up\nFIG 6-2-14Affirmative (Aircraft)\nFIG 6-2-15Negative (Aircraft)\nFIG 6-2-16Message received and understood (Aircraft)\nFIG 6-2-17Message received and NOT understood (Aircraft)"

                "section-title": "Helicopter Flight Control Systems",
                "section-content": "The certification requirements for helicopters to operate under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) are contained in 14 CFR Part 27, Airworthiness Standards: Normal Category Rotorcraft, and 14 CFR Part\u200929, Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Rotorcraft. To meet these requirements, helicopter manufacturers usually utilize a set of stabilization and/or Automatic Flight Control Systems (AFCSs).\n\n\nTypically, these systems fall into the following categories:\n\nAerodynamic surfaces, which impart some stability or control capability not found in the basic VFR configuration.\n\n\nTrim systems, which provide a cyclic centering effect. These systems typically involve a magnetic brake/spring device, and may also be controlled by a four-way switch on the cyclic. This is a system that supports \u201chands on\u201d flying of the helicopter by the pilot.\n\nStability Augmentation Systems (SASs), which provide short-term rate damping control inputs to increase helicopter stability. Like trim systems, SAS supports \u201chands on\u201d flying.\n\nAttitude Retention Systems (ATTs), which return the helicopter to a selected attitude after a disturbance. Changes in desired attitude can be accomplished usually through a four-way \u201cbeep\u201d switch, or by actuating a \u201cforce trim\u201d switch on the cyclic, setting the attitude manually, and releasing. Attitude retention may be a SAS function, or may be the basic \u201chands off\u201d autopilot function.\n\nAutopilot Systems (APs), which provide for \u201chands off\u201d flight along specified lateral and vertical paths, including heading, altitude, vertical speed, navigation tracking, and approach. These systems typically have a control panel for mode selection, and system for indication of mode status. Autopilots may or may not be installed with an associated Flight Director System (FD). Autopilots typically control the helicopter about the roll and pitch axes (cyclic control) but may also include yaw axis (pedal control) and collective control servos.\n\nFDs, which provide visual guidance to the pilot to fly specific selected lateral and vertical modes of operation. The visual guidance is typically provided as either a \u201cdual cue\u201d (commonly known as a \u201ccross-pointer\u201d) or \u201csingle cue\u201d (commonly known as a \u201cvee-bar\u201d) presentation superimposed over the attitude indicator. Some FDs also include a collective cue. The pilot manipulates the helicopter's controls to satisfy these commands, yielding the desired flight path, or may couple the flight director to the autopilot to perform automatic flight along the desired flight path. Typically, flight director mode control and indication is shared with the autopilot.\n\nIn order to be certificated for IFR operation, a specific helicopter may require the use of one or more of these systems, in any combination.\n\nIn many cases, helicopters are certificated for IFR operations with either one or two pilots. Certain equipment is required to be installed and functional for two pilot operations, and typically, additional equipment is required for single pilot operation. These requirements are usually described in the limitations section of the Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM).\n\nIn addition, the RFM also typically defines systems and functions that are required to be in operation or engaged for IFR flight in either the single or two pilot configuration. Often, particularly in two pilot operation, this level of augmentation is less than the full capability of the installed systems. Likewise, single pilot operation may require a higher level of augmentation.\n\nThe RFM also identifies other specific limitations associated with IFR flight. Typically, these limitations include, but are not limited to:\n\nMinimum equipment required for IFR flight (in some cases, for both single pilot and two pilot operations).\n\n\nVmini (minimum speed - IFR).\n\nNOTE-\nThe manufacturer may also recommend a minimum IFR airspeed during instrument approach.\n\nVnei (never exceed speed - IFR).\n\nMaximum approach angle.\n\nWeight and center of gravity limits.\n\nAircraft configuration limitations (such as aircraft door positions and external loads).\n\nAircraft system limitations (generators, inverters, etc.).\n\nSystem testing requirements (many avionics and AFCS/AP/FD systems incorporate a self-test feature).\n\nPilot action requirements (such as the pilot must have his/her hands and feet on the controls during certain operations, such as during instrument approach below certain altitudes).\n\nIt is very important that pilots be familiar with the IFR requirements for their particular helicopter. Within the same make, model and series of helicopter, variations in the installed avionics may change the required equipment or the level of augmentation for a particular operation.\n\nDuring flight operations, pilots must be aware of the mode of operation of the augmentation systems, and the control logic and functions employed. For example, during an ILS approach using a particular system in the three-cue mode (lateral, vertical and collective cues), the flight director collective cue responds to glideslope deviation, while the horizontal bar of the \u201ccross-pointer\u201d responds to airspeed deviations. The same system, while flying an ILS in the two-cue mode, provides for the horizontal bar to respond to glideslope deviations. This concern is particularly significant when operating using two pilots. Pilots should have an established set of procedures and responsibilities for the control of flight director/autopilot modes for the various phases of flight. Not only does a full understanding of the system modes provide for a higher degree of accuracy in control of the helicopter, it is the basis for crew identification of a faulty system.\n\nRelief from the prohibition to takeoff with any inoperative instruments or equipment may be provided through a Minimum Equipment List (see 14\u2009CFR Section 91.213 and 14 CFR Section\u2009135.179, Inoperative Instruments and Equipment). In many cases, a helicopter configured for single pilot IFR may depart IFR with certain equipment inoperative, provided a crew of two pilots is used. Pilots are cautioned to ensure the pilot-in-command and second-in-command meet the requirements of 14\u2009CFR Section 61.58, Pilot-in-Command Proficiency Check: Operation of Aircraft Requiring More Than One Pilot Flight Crewmember, and 14 CFR Section 61.55, Second-in-Command Qualifications, or 14 CFR Part\u2009135, Operating Requirements: Commuter and On-Demand Operations, Subpart E, Flight Crewmember Requirements, and Subpart\u2009G, Crewmember Testing Requirements, as appropriate.\n\nExperience has shown that modern AFCS/AP/FD equipment installed in IFR helicopters can, in some cases, be very complex. This complexity requires the pilot(s) to obtain and maintain a high level of knowledge of system operation, limitations, failure indications and reversionary modes. In some cases, this may only be reliably accomplished through formal training."

IFPs can be designed for both public and private heliports using FAA instrument criteria. The FAA does recognize there are non-FAA service providers with proprietary special criteria. Special IFPs are reviewed and approved by Flight Technologies and Procedures Division and may have specified aircraft performance or equipment requirements, special crew training, airport facility equipment, waivers from published standards, proprietary criteria and restricted access. Special IFPs are not published in the Federal Register or printed in government Flight Information Publications.\n\n\nHelicopters are capable of flying any published IFPs, for which they are properly equipped, subject to the following limitations and conditions:\n\nHelicopters flying conventional (i.e. non-Copter) IAPs may reduce the visibility minima to not less than one-half the published Category A landing visibility minima, or 1/4 statute mile visibility/1200\u2009RVR, whichever is greater, unless the procedure is annotated with \u201cVisibility Reduction by Helicopters NA.\" This annotation means that there are penetrations of the final approach obstacle identification surface (OIS) and that the 14\u2009CFR Section\u200997.3 visibility reduction rule does not apply and you must take precaution to avoid any obstacles in the visual segment. No reduction in MDA/DA is permitted at any time. The helicopter may initiate the final approach segment at speeds up to the upper limit of the highest approach category authorized by the procedure, but must be slowed to no more than 90\u2009KIAS at the missed approach point (MAP) in order to apply the visibility reduction. Pilots are cautioned that such a decelerating approach may make early identification of wind shear on the approach path difficult or impossible. If required, use the Inoperative Components and Visual Aids Table provided inside the front cover of the U.S. Terminal Procedures Publication to derive the Category A minima before applying the 14 CFR Section 97.3 rule.\n\n\nHelicopters flying Copter IAPs should use the published minima, with no reductions allowed. Unless otherwise specified on the instrument procedure chart, 90 KIAS is the  maximum speed on the approach.\n\nPilots flying Area Navigation (RNAV) Copter IAPs should also limit their speed to 90 KIAS unless otherwise specified on the instrument procedure chart. The final and missed approach segment speeds must be limited to no more than 70 KIAS unless otherwise charted.  Military RNAV Copter IAPs are limited to no more than 90 KIAS throughout the procedure. Use the published minima; no reductions allowed.\n\nNOTE-\nObstruction clearance surfaces are based on the aircraft speed identified on the approach chart and have been designed on RNAV approaches for 70\u2009knots unless otherwise indicated. If the helicopter is flown at higher speeds, it may fly outside of protected airspace. Some helicopters have a VMINI\u00a0greater than 70 knots; therefore, they cannot meet the 70 knot limitation to conduct these RNAV approaches. Some helicopter autopilots, when used in the \u201cgo-around\" mode, are programmed with a VYI\u00a0greater than 70 knots. Therefore, those helicopters when using the autopilot \u201cgo-around\" mode, cannot meet the 70 knot limitation for the RNAV approach. It may be possible to use the autopilot for the missed approach in other than the \u201cgo-around\" mode and meet the 70 knot limitation. When operating at speeds other than VYI\u00a0or VY, performance data may not be available in the RFM to predict compliance with climb gradient requirements. Pilots may use observed performance in similar weight/altitude/temperature/speed conditions to evaluate the suitability of performance. Pilots are cautioned to monitor climb performance to ensure compliance with procedure requirements.\n\nNOTE-\nVMINI - Instrument flight minimum speed, utilized in complying with minimum limit speed requirements for instrument flight\nVYI - Instrument climb speed, utilized instead of VY\u00a0for compliance with the climb requirements for instrument flight\nVY - Speed for best rate of climb\n\nTBL 10-1-1 summarizes these requirements.\n\nEven with weather conditions reported at or above minimums, under some combinations of reduced cockpit cutoff angle, approach/runway lighting, and high MDA/DH (coupled with a low visibility minima), the pilot may not be able to identify the required visual reference(s), or those references may only be visible in a very small portion of the available field of view. Even if identified by the pilot, the visual references may not support normal maneuvering and normal rates of descent to landing. The effect of such a combination may be exacerbated by other conditions such as rain on the windshield, or incomplete windshield defogging coverage.\n\nPilots should always be prepared to execute a missed approach even though weather conditions may be reported at or above minimums.\n\nNOTE-\nSee paragraph 5-4-21, Missed Approach, for additional information on missed approach procedures.\nTBL 10-1-1Helicopter Use of Standard Instrument Approach Procedures\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nHelicopter Visibility Minima\n\n\nHelicopter MDA/DA\n\n\nMaximum Speed Limitations\n\n\n\n\nConventional (non-Copter)\n\n\nThe greater of: one half the Category A visibility minima, 1/4 statute mile visibility, or 1200 RVR\n\n\nAs published for Category\u2009A\n\n\nThe helicopter may initiate the final approach segment at speeds up to the upper limit of the highest approach category authorized by the procedure, but must be slowed to no more than 90 KIAS at the MAP in order to apply the visibility reduction.\n\n\n\n\nCopter Procedure\n\n\nAs published\n\n\nAs published\n\n\n90 KIAS maximum when on a published route/track.\n\n\n\n\nRNAV (GPS) Copter Procedure\n\n\nAs published\n\n\nAs published\n\n\nThe maximum speed for a Copter approach will be 90 KIAS or as published on the chart.

                "section-content": "The FAA may develop helicopter instrument approaches for heliports that do not meet the design standards for an IFR heliport. The majority of IFR approaches to VFR heliports are developed in support of Helicopter Air Ambulance (HAA) operators. These approaches may require use of conventional NAVAIDS or a RNAV system (e.g., GPS). They may be developed either as a special approach (pilot training is required for special procedures due to their unique characteristics) or a public approach (no special training required). These instrument procedures may be designed to guide the helicopter to a specific landing area (Proceed Visually) or to a point-in-space with a \u201cProceed VFR\u201d segment.\n\nAn approach to a specific landing area. This type of approach is aligned to a missed approach point from which a landing can be accomplished with a maximum course change of 30 degrees. The visual segment from the MAP to the landing area is evaluated for obstacle hazards. These procedures are annotated: \u201cPROCEED VISUALLY FROM (named MAP) OR CONDUCT THE SPECIFIED MISSED APPROACH.\u201d\n\n\u201cProceed Visually\u201d requires the pilot to acquire and maintain visual contact with the landing area at or prior to the MAP, or execute a missed approach. The visibility minimum is based on the distance from the MAP to the landing area, among other factors.\n\n\nThe pilot is required to have the published minimum visibility throughout the visual segment flying the path described on the approach chart.\n\nSimilar to an approach to a runway, the pilot is responsible for obstacle or terrain avoidance from the MAP to the landing area.\n\nUpon reaching the published MAP, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the pilot should advise ATC whether proceeding visually and canceling IFR or complying with the missed approach instructions. See paragraph 5-1-15, Canceling IFR Flight Plan.\n\nWhere any necessary visual reference requirements are specified by the FAA, at least one of the following visual references for the intended heliport is visible and identifiable before the pilot may proceed visually:\n\nFATO or FATO lights.\n\n\nTLOF or TLOF lights.\n\nHeliport Instrument Lighting System (HILS).\n\nHeliport Approach Lighting System (HALS).\n\nVisual Glideslope Indicator (VGSI).\n\nWindsock or windsock light.\n\nHeliport beacon.\n\nOther facilities or systems approved by the Flight Technologies and Procedures Division (AFS-400).\n\n\nApproach to a Point-in-Space (PinS). At locations where the MAP is located more than 2 SM from the landing area, or the path from the MAP to the landing area is populated with obstructions which require avoidance actions or requires turn greater than 30 degrees, a PinS Proceed VFR procedure may be developed. These approaches are annotated \u201cPROCEED VFR FROM (named MAP) OR CONDUCT THE SPECIFIED MISSED APPROACH.\u201d\n\nThese procedures require the pilot, at or prior to the MAP, to determine if the published minimum visibility, or the weather minimums required by the operating rule (e.g., Part 91, Part 135, etc.), or operations specifications (whichever is higher) is available to safely transition from IFR to VFR flight. If not, the pilot must execute a missed approach. For Part 135 operations, pilots may not begin the instrument approach unless the latest weather report indicates that the weather conditions are at or above the authorized IFR minimums or the VFR weather minimums (as required by the class of airspace, operating rule and/or Operations Specifications) whichever is higher.\n\n\nVisual contact with the landing site is not required; however, the pilot must have the appropriate VFR weather minimums throughout the visual segment. The visibility is limited to no lower than that published in the procedure, until canceling IFR.\n\nIFR obstruction clearance areas are not applied to the VFR segment between the MAP and the landing site. Pilots are responsible for obstacle or terrain avoidance from the MAP to the landing area.\n\nUpon reaching the MAP defined on the approach procedure, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the pilot should advise ATC whether proceeding VFR and canceling IFR, or complying with the missed approach instructions. See paragraph 5-1-15, Canceling IFR Flight Plan.\n\nIf the visual segment penetrates Class B, C, or D airspace, pilots are responsible for obtaining a Special VFR clearance, when required."

                "section-title": "The Gulf of Mexico Grid System",
                "section-content": "On October 8, 1998, the Southwest Regional Office of the FAA, with assistance from the Helicopter Safety Advisory Conference (HSAC), implemented the world's first Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Grid System in the Gulf of Mexico. This navigational route structure is completely independent of ground-based navigation aids (NAVAIDs) and was designed to facilitate helicopter IFR operations to offshore destinations. The Grid System is defined by over 300\u2009offshore waypoints located 20 minutes apart (latitude and longitude). Flight plan routes are routinely defined by just 4 segments: departure point (lat/long), first en route grid waypoint, last en route grid waypoint prior to approach procedure, and destination point (lat/long). There are over 4,000\u2009possible offshore landing sites. Upon reaching the waypoint prior to the destination, the pilot may execute an Offshore Standard Approach Procedure (OSAP), a Helicopter En Route Descent Areas (HEDA) approach, or an Airborne Radar Approach (ARA). For more information on these helicopter instrument procedures, refer to FAA AC 90-80B, Approval of Offshore Standard Approach Procedures, Airborne Radar Approaches, and Helicopter En Route Descent Areas, on the FAA website http://www.faa.gov under Advisory Circulars. The return flight plan is just the reverse with the requested stand-alone GPS approach contained in the remarks section.\n\nThe large number (over 300) of waypoints in the grid system makes it difficult to assign phonetically pronounceable names to the waypoints that would be meaningful to pilots and controllers. A unique naming system was adopted that enables pilots and controllers to derive the fix position from the name. The five-letter names are derived as follows:\n\nThe waypoints are divided into sets of 3\u2009columns each. A three-letter identifier, identifying a geographical area or a NAVAID to the north, represents each set.\n\n\nEach column in a set is named after its position, i.e., left (L), center (C), and right (R).\n\nThe rows of the grid are named alphabetically from north to south, starting with A for the northern most row.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nLCHRC would be pronounced \u201cLake Charles Romeo Charlie.\u201d The waypoint is in the right-hand column of the Lake Charles VOR set, in row C (third south from the northern most row).\n\nIn December 2009, significant improvements to the Gulf of Mexico grid system were realized with the introduction of ATC separation services using ADS-B. In cooperation with the oil and gas services industry, HSAC and Helicopter Association International (HAI), the FAA installed an infrastructure of ADS-B ground stations, weather stations (AWOS) and VHF remote communication outlets (RCO) throughout a large area of the Gulf of Mexico. This infrastructure allows the FAA's Houston ARTCC to provide \u201cdomestic-like\u201d air traffic control service in the offshore area beyond 12nm from the coastline to hundreds of miles offshore to aircraft equipped with ADS-B. Properly equipped aircraft can now be authorized to receive more direct routing, domestic en route separation minima and real time flight following. Operators who do not have authorization to receive ATC separation services using ADS-B, will continue to use the low altitude grid system and receive procedural separation from Houston ARTCC. Non-ADS-B equipped aircraft also benefit from improved VHF communication and expanded weather information coverage.\n\nThree requirements must be met for operators to file IFR flight plans utilizing the grid:\n\nThe helicopter must be equipped for IFR operations and equipped with IFR approved GPS navigational units.\n\n\nThe operator must obtain prior written approval from the appropriate Flight Standards District Office through a Letter of Authorization or Operations Specification, as appropriate.\n\nThe operator must be a signatory to the Houston ARTCC Letter of Agreement.\n\nOperators who wish to benefit from ADS-B based ATC separation services must meet the following additional requirements:\n\nThe Operator's installed ADS-B Out equipment must meet the performance requirements of one of the following FAA Technical Standard Orders (TSO), or later revisions: TSO-C154c, Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Equipment, or TSO-C166b, Extended Squitter Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Traffic Information.\n\n\nFlight crews must comply with the procedures prescribed in the Houston ARTCC Letter of Agreement dated December 17, 2009, or later.\n\nNOTE-\nThe unique ADS-B architecture in the Gulf of Mexico depends upon reception of an aircraft's Mode C in addition to the other message elements described in 14 CFR 91.227. Flight crews must be made aware that loss of Mode C also means that ATC will not receive the aircraft's ADS-B signal.\n\nFAA/AIS publishes the grid system waypoints on the IFR Gulf of Mexico Vertical Flight Reference Chart. A commercial equivalent is also available. The chart is updated annually and is available from an FAA approved print provider\u2009or\u2009FAA\u2009directly, website address: http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav."

Runway numbers and letters are determined from the approach direction. The runway number is the whole number nearest one\u2010tenth the magnetic azimuth of the centerline of the runway, measured clockwise from the magnetic north. The letters, differentiate between left (L), right\u2009(R), or center (C) parallel runways, as applicable:\n\nFor two parallel runways \u201cL\u201d \u201cR.\u201d\n\n\nFor three parallel runways \u201cL\u201d \u201cC\u201d \u201cR.\u201d\n\nRunway Centerline Marking. The runway centerline identifies the center of the runway and provides alignment guidance during takeoff and landings. The centerline consists of a line of uniformly spaced stripes and gaps.\n\nRunway Aiming Point Marking. The aiming point marking serves as a visual aiming point for a landing aircraft. These two rectangular markings consist of a broad white stripe located on each side of the runway centerline and approximately 1,000 feet from the landing threshold, as shown in FIG 2-3-1, Precision Instrument Runway Markings.\n\nRunway Touchdown Zone Markers. The touchdown zone markings identify the touchdown zone for landing operations and are coded to provide distance information in 500 feet (150m) increments. These markings consist of groups of one, two, and three rectangular bars symmetrically arranged in pairs about the runway centerline, as shown in FIG 2-3-1. For runways having touchdown zone markings on both ends, those pairs of markings which extend to within 900 feet (270 m) of the midpoint between the thresholds are eliminated.\nFIG 2-3-2Nonprecision Instrument Runway and Visual Runway Markings\n\nRunway Side Stripe Marking. Runway side stripes delineate the edges of the runway. They provide a visual contrast between runway and the abutting terrain or shoulders. Side stripes consist of continuous white stripes located on each side of the runway as shown in FIG 2-3-4.\n\nRunway Shoulder Markings. Runway shoulder stripes may be used to supplement runway side stripes to identify pavement areas contiguous to the runway sides that are not intended for use by aircraft. Runway shoulder stripes are yellow. (See FIG 2-3-5.)\n\nRunway Threshold Markings. Runway threshold markings come in two configurations. They either consist of eight longitudinal stripes of uniform dimensions disposed symmetrically about the runway centerline (as shown in FIG 2-3-1) or the number of stripes is related to the runway width as indicated in TBL 2-3-2. A threshold marking helps identify the beginning of the runway that is available for landing. In some instances, the landing threshold may be relocated or displaced.\nTBL 2-3-2Number of Runway Threshold Stripes\n\n\n\nRunway Width\n\n\nNumber of Stripes\n\n\n\n\n60 feet (18 m)\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n75 feet (23 m)\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n100 feet (30 m)\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n150 feet (45 m)\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n200 feet (60 m)\n\n\n16\n\n\n\nRelocation of a Threshold. Sometimes construction, maintenance, or other activities require the threshold to be relocated towards the rollout end of the runway. (See FIG 2-3-3.) When a threshold is relocated, it closes not only a set portion of the approach end of a runway, but also shortens the length of the opposite direction runway. In these cases, a NOTAM should be issued by the airport operator identifying the portion of the runway that is closed (for example, 10/28 W 900 CLSD). Because the duration of the relocation can vary from a few hours to several months, methods identifying the new threshold may vary. One common practice is to use a ten feet wide white threshold bar across the width of the runway. Although the runway lights in the area between the old threshold and new threshold will not be illuminated, the runway markings in this area may or may not be obliterated, removed, or covered.\n\n\nDisplaced Threshold. A displaced threshold is a threshold located at a point on the runway other than the designated beginning of the runway. Displacement of a threshold reduces the length of runway available for landings. The portion of runway behind a displaced threshold is available for takeoffs in either direction and landings from the opposite direction. A ten feet wide white threshold bar is located across the width of the runway at the displaced threshold. White arrows are located along the centerline in the area between the beginning of the runway and displaced threshold. White arrow heads are located across the width of the runway just prior to the threshold bar, as shown in FIG 2-3-4.\n\nNOTE-\nAirport operator. When reporting the relocation or displacement of a threshold, the airport operator should avoid language which confuses the two.\n\nDemarcation Bar. A demarcation bar delineates a runway with a displaced threshold from a blast pad, stopway, or taxiway that precedes the runway. A demarcation bar is 3 feet (1m) wide and yellow, since it is not located on the runway, as shown in FIG 2-3-6.\n\nChevrons. These markings are used to show pavement areas aligned with the runway that are unusable for landing, takeoff, and taxiing. Chevrons are yellow. (See FIG 2-3-7.)\n\n\nRunway Threshold Bar. A threshold bar delineates the beginning of the runway that is available for landing when the threshold has been relocated or displaced. A threshold bar is 10 feet (3m) in width and extends across the width of the runway, as shown in FIG 2-3-4.\nFIG 2-3-3Relocation of a Threshold with Markings for Taxiway Aligned with Runway\nFIG 2-3-4Displaced Threshold Markings\nFIG 2-3-5Runway Shoulder Markings"

Taxiway edge markings are present whenever there is a need to separate the taxiway from a pavement that is not intended for aircraft use or to delineate the edge of the taxiway. Taxiways may also have shoulder markings and holding position markings for Instrument Landing System (ILS) critical areas and taxiway/taxiway intersection markings.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 2-3-5, Holding Position Markings.\n\n\n\nTaxiway Centerline.\n\nNormal Centerline. The taxiway centerline is a single continuous yellow line, 6 inches (15 cm) to 12 inches (30 cm) in width. This provides a visual cue to permit taxiing along a designated path.  Ideally, the aircraft should be kept centered over this line during taxi. However, being centered on the taxiway centerline does not guarantee wingtip clearance with other aircraft or other objects.\n\n\nEnhanced Centerline. At some airports, mostly the larger commercial service airports, an enhanced taxiway centerline will be used. The enhanced taxiway centerline marking consists of a parallel line of yellow dashes on either side of the normal taxiway centerline. The taxiway centerlines are enhanced for a maximum of 150 feet prior to a runway holding position marking. The purpose of this enhancement is to warn the pilot that he/she is approaching a runway holding position marking and should prepare to stop unless he/she has been cleared onto or across the runway by ATC. (See FIG 2-3-8.)\n\nTaxiway Edge Markings. Taxiway edge markings are used to define the edge of the taxiway. They are primarily used when the taxiway edge does not correspond with the edge of the pavement. There are two types of markings depending upon whether the aircraft is supposed to cross the taxiway edge:\n\nContinuous Markings. These consist of a continuous double yellow line, with each line being at least 6 inches (15 cm) in width spaced 6 inches (15\u2009cm) apart. They are used to define the taxiway edge from the shoulder or some other abutting paved surface not intended for use by aircraft.\n\n\nDashed Markings. These markings are used when there is an operational need to define the edge of a taxiway or taxilane on a paved surface where the adjoining pavement to the taxiway edge is intended for use by aircraft (for example, an apron). Dashed taxiway edge markings consist of a broken double yellow line, with each line being at least 6 inches (15\u2009cm) in width, spaced 6 inches (15 cm) apart (edge to edge). These lines are 15 feet (4.5 m) in length with 25 foot (7.5 m) gaps. (See FIG 2-3-9.)\n\nTaxi Shoulder Markings. Taxiways, holding bays, and aprons are sometimes provided with paved shoulders to prevent blast and water erosion. Although shoulders may have the appearance of full strength pavement, they are not intended for use by aircraft and may be unable to support an aircraft. Usually the taxiway edge marking will define this area. Where conditions exist such as islands or taxiway curves that may cause confusion as to which side of the edge stripe is for use by aircraft, taxiway shoulder markings may be used to indicate the pavement is unusable. Taxiway shoulder markings are yellow. (See FIG 2-3-10.)\nFIG 2-3-6Markings for Blast Pad or Stopway or Taxiway Preceding a Displaced Threshold\nFIG 2-3-7Markings for Blast Pads and Stopways\nFIG 2-3-8Enhanced Taxiway Centerline\nFIG 2-3-9Dashed Markings\n\nSurface Painted Taxiway Direction Signs. Surface painted taxiway direction signs have a yellow background with a black inscription, and are provided when it is not possible to provide taxiway direction signs at intersections, or when necessary to supplement such signs. These markings are located adjacent to the centerline with signs indicating turns to the left being on the left side of the taxiway centerline, and signs indicating turns to the right being on the right side of the centerline. (See FIG 2-3-11.)\nFIG 2-3-10Taxi Shoulder Markings\n\nSurface Painted Location Signs. Surface painted location signs have a black background with a yellow inscription. When necessary, these markings are used to supplement location signs located along side the taxiway and assist the pilot in confirming the designation of the taxiway on which the aircraft is located. These markings are located on the right side of the centerline. (See FIG 2-3-11.)\n\nGeographic Position Markings. These markings are located at points along low visibility taxi routes designated in the airport's Surface Movement Guidance Control System (SMGCS) plan. They are used to identify the location of taxiing aircraft during low visibility operations. Low visibility operations are those that occur when the runway visible range\u2009(RVR) is below 1200 feet (360m). They are positioned to the left of the taxiway centerline in the direction of taxiing. (See FIG 2-3-12.) The geographic position marking is a circle comprised of an outer black ring contiguous to a white ring with a pink circle in the middle. When installed on asphalt or other dark\u2010colored pavements, the white ring and the black ring are reversed (i.e., the white ring becomes the outer ring and the black ring becomes the inner ring). It is designated with either a number or a number and letter. The number corresponds to the consecutive position of the marking on the route.\nFIG 2-3-11Surface Painted Signs"

They consist of four yellow lines, two solid and two dashed, spaced six or twelve inches apart, and extending across the width of the taxiway or runway. The solid lines are always on the side where the aircraft must hold. There are three locations where runway holding position markings are encountered.\n\nRunway Holding Position Markings on Taxiways. These markings identify the locations on a taxiway where aircraft MUST STOP when a clearance has not been issued to proceed onto the runway. Generally, runway holding position markings also identify the boundary of the runway safety area (RSA) for aircraft exiting the runway. Runway holding position markings are shown in FIG 2-3-13 and FIG 2-3-16. When instructed by ATC, \u201cHold short of Runway XX,\u201d the pilot MUST STOP so that no part of the aircraft extends beyond the runway holding position marking. When approaching runways at airports with an operating control tower, pilots must not cross the runway holding position marking without ATC clearance. Pilots approaching runways at airports without an operating control tower must ensure adequate separation from other aircraft, vehicles, and pedestrians prior to crossing the holding position markings. An aircraft exiting a runway is not clear of the runway until all parts of the aircraft have crossed the applicable holding position marking.\n\nNOTE-\nRunway holding position markings identify the beginning of an RSA, and a pilot MUST STOP to get clearance before crossing (at airports with operating control towers).\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 4-3-21, Exiting the Runway After Landing.\n\n\n\nRunway Holding Position Markings on Runways. These markings identify the locations on runways where aircraft MUST STOP. These markings are located on runways used by ATC for Land And Hold Short Operations (for example, see FIG 4-3-8) and Taxiing operations. For taxiing operations, the pilot MUST STOP prior to the holding position markings unless explicitly authorized to cross by ATC. A sign with a white inscription on a red background is located adjacent to these holding position markings. (See FIG 2-3-14.) The holding position markings are placed on runways prior to the intersection with another runway, or some designated point. Pilots receiving and accepting instructions \u201cCleared to land Runway XX, hold short of Runway YY\u201d from ATC must either exit Runway XX prior to the holding position markings, or stop at the holding position markings prior to Runway YY. Otherwise, pilots are authorized to use the entire landing length of the runway and disregard the holding position markings.\n\nHolding Position Markings on Taxiways Located in Runway Approach Areas. These markings are used at some airports where it is necessary to hold an aircraft on a taxiway located in the approach or departure area of a runway so that the aircraft does not interfere with the operations on that runway. This marking is collocated with the runway approach/departure area holding position sign. When specifically instructed by ATC, \u201cHold short of Runway XX approach or Runway XX departure area,\u201d the pilot MUST STOP so that no part of the aircraft extends beyond the holding position marking. (See Subparagraph\u20092-3-8b2, Runway Approach Area Holding Position Sign, and FIG 2-3-15.)\n\n\nHolding Position Markings for Instrument Landing System (ILS). Holding position markings for ILS critical areas consist of two yellow solid lines spaced two feet apart connected by pairs of solid lines spaced ten feet apart extending across the width of the taxiway as shown. (See FIG 2-3-16.) A sign with an inscription in white on a red background is located adjacent to these hold position markings. When instructed by ATC to hold short of the ILS critical area, pilots MUST STOP so that no part of the aircraft extends beyond the holding position marking. When approaching the holding position marking, pilots must not cross the marking without ATC clearance. The ILS critical area is not clear until all parts of the aircraft have crossed the applicable holding position marking.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 1-1-9, Instrument Landing System (ILS).\n\n\nHolding Position Markings for Intersecting Taxiways Holding position markings for intersecting taxiways consist of a single dashed line extending across the width of the taxiway as shown. (See FIG 2-3-17.) They are located on taxiways where ATC holds aircraft short of a taxiway intersection. When instructed by ATC, \u201cHold short of Taxiway XX,\u201d the pilot MUST STOP so that no part of the aircraft extends beyond the holding position marking. When the marking is not present, the pilot MUST STOP the aircraft at a point which provides adequate clearance from an aircraft on the intersecting taxiway.\n\nSurface Painted Holding Position Signs. Surface painted holding position signs have a red background with a white inscription and supplement the signs located at the holding position. This type of marking is normally used where the width of the holding position on the taxiway is greater than 200\u2009feet (60 m). It is located to the left side of the taxiway centerline on the holding side and prior to the holding position marking.

This sign is located at the holding position on taxiways that intersect a runway or on runways that intersect other runways. The inscription on the sign contains the designation of the intersecting runway, as shown in FIG 2-3-24. The runway numbers on the sign are arranged to correspond to the respective runway threshold. For example, \u201c15-33\u201d indicates that the threshold for Runway 15 is to the left and the threshold for Runway 33 is to the right.\n\nOn taxiways that intersect the beginning of the takeoff runway, only the designation of the takeoff runway may appear on the sign (as shown in FIG 2-3-25), while all other signs will have the designation of both runway directions.\nFIG 2-3-26Holding Position Sign for a Taxiway that Intersects the Intersection of Two Runways\nFIG 2-3-27Holding Position Sign for Runway Approach and Departure Areas\n\n\nIf the sign is located on a taxiway that intersects the intersection of two runways, the designations for both runways will be shown on the sign along with arrows showing the approximate alignment of each runway, as shown in FIG 2-3-26. In addition to showing the approximate runway alignment, the arrow indicates the direction to the threshold of the runway whose designation is immediately next to the arrow.\n\nA runway holding position sign on a taxiway will be installed adjacent to holding position markings on the taxiway pavement. On runways, holding position markings will be located only on the runway pavement adjacent to the sign, if the runway is normally used by ATC for \u201cLand, Hold Short\u201d operations or as a taxiway. The holding position markings are described in paragraph 2-3-5, Holding Position Markings.\n\n\nRunway Approach Area Holding Position Sign. At some airports, it is necessary to hold an aircraft on a taxiway located in the approach or departure area for a runway so that the aircraft does not interfere with operations on that runway. FIG 2-3-15 depicts common situations. A sign with the runway designation(s) and the protected area(s) will be located at applicable holding positions on the taxiway. For locations protecting only the approach area, the holding position on the taxiway includes a sign identifying the approach end runway designation (e.g., 15) followed by a dash (-) and the letters \u201cAPCH\u201d. For locations protecting both the approach and departure areas, the holding position on the taxiway includes a sign with the approach end runway designation and letters \u201cAPCH\u201d followed by a dash (-), the departure end runway designation and the letters \u201cDEP\u201d. The arrangement of the runway designations and protected areas legend on the sign reflects the orientation of the runway as viewed from the holding position. Holding position markings in accordance with paragraph 2-3-5, Holding Position Markings, are co-located on the taxiway pavement in line with the sign. Examples of these signs are shown in FIG 2-3-27.\nFIG 2-3-28Holding Position Sign for ILS Critical Area\nFIG 2-3-29Sign Prohibiting Aircraft Entry into an Area\n\nILS Critical Area Holding Position Sign. At some airports, when the instrument landing system is being used, it is necessary to hold an aircraft on a taxiway at a location other than the holding position described in Paragraph 2-3-5, Holding Position Markings. In these situations, the holding position sign for these operations will have the inscription \u201cILS\u201d and be located adjacent to the holding position marking on the taxiway described in paragraph 2-3-5. An example of this sign is shown in FIG 2-3-28.\n\nNo Entry Sign. This sign, shown in FIG 2-3-29, prohibits an aircraft from entering an area.

The link can be a strong bond between pilot and controller or it can be broken with surprising speed and disastrous results. Discussion herein provides basic procedures for new pilots and also highlights safe operating concepts for all pilots.\n\n\nThe single, most important thought in pilot\u2010controller communications is understanding. It is essential, therefore, that pilots acknowledge each radio communication with ATC by using the appropriate aircraft call sign. Brevity is important, and contacts should be kept as brief as possible, but controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their control duties. And you, the pilot, must know exactly what the controller wants you to do. Since concise phraseology may not always be adequate, use whatever words are necessary to get your message across. Pilots are to maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio communications frequencies for potential traffic conflicts with their aircraft especially when operating on an active runway and/or when conducting a final approach to landing.\n\nAll pilots will find the Pilot/Controller Glossary very helpful in learning what certain words or phrases mean. Good phraseology enhances safety and is the mark of a professional pilot. Jargon, chatter, and \u201cCB\u201d slang have no place in ATC communications. The Pilot/Controller Glossary is the same glossary used in FAA Order JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control.

                "section-content": "Listen before you transmit. Many times you can get the information you want through ATIS or by monitoring the frequency. Except for a few situations where some frequency overlap occurs, if you hear someone else talking, the keying of your transmitter will be futile and you will probably jam their receivers causing them to repeat their call. If you have just changed frequencies, pause, listen, and make sure the frequency is clear.\n\n\nThink before keying your transmitter. Know what you want to say and if it is lengthy; e.g., a flight plan or IFR position report, jot it down.\n\nThe microphone should be very close to your lips and after pressing the mike button, a slight pause may be necessary to be sure the first word is transmitted. Speak in a normal, conversational tone.\n\nWhen you release the button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The controller or FSS specialist may be jotting down your number, looking for your flight plan, transmitting on a different frequency, or selecting the transmitter for your frequency.\n\nBe alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in your receiver. Check your volume, recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods of time due to unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a \u201cstuck mike,\u201d and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to assign an alternate frequency. If the assigned frequency is completely blocked by this type of interference, use the procedures described for en route IFR radio frequency outage to establish or reestablish communications with ATC.\n\nBe sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the ground station equipment. Remote radio sites do not always transmit and receive on all of a facility's available frequencies, particularly with regard to VOR sites where you can hear but not reach a ground station's receiver. Remember that higher altitudes increase the range of VHF \u201cline of sight\u201d communications."

                "section-content": "Initial Contact.\n\nThe terms initial contact or initial callup means the first radio call you make to a given facility or the first call to a different controller or FSS specialist within a facility. Use the following format:\n\nName of the facility being called;\n\n\nYour full aircraft identification as filed in the flight plan or as discussed in paragraph 4-2-4, Aircraft Call Signs;\n\nWhen operating on an airport surface, state your position.\n\nThe type of message to follow or your request if it is short; and\n\nThe word \u201cOver\u201d if required.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cNew York Radio, Mooney Three One One Echo.\u201d\u201cColumbia Ground, Cessna Three One Six Zero Foxtrot, south ramp, I-F-R Memphis.\u201d\u201cMiami Center, Baron Five Six Three Hotel, request V-F-R traffic advisories.\u201d\n\n\nMany FSSs are equipped with Remote Communications Outlets (RCOs) and can transmit on the same frequency at more than one location. The frequencies available at specific locations are indicated on charts above FSS communications boxes. To enable the specialist to utilize the correct transmitter, advise the location and the frequency on which you expect a reply.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nSt. Louis FSS can transmit on frequency 122.3 at either Farmington, Missouri, or Decatur, Illinois, if you are in the vicinity of Decatur, your callup should be \u201cSaint Louis radio, Piper Six Niner Six Yankee, receiving Decatur One Two Two Point Three.\u201d\nIf radio reception is reasonably assured, inclusion of your request, your position or altitude, and the phrase \u201c(ATIS) Information Charlie received\u201d in the initial contact helps decrease radio frequency congestion. Use discretion; do not overload the controller with information unneeded or superfluous. If you do not get a response from the ground station, recheck your radios or use another transmitter, but keep the next contact short.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cAtlanta Center, Duke Four One Romeo, request V-F-R traffic advisories, Twenty Northwest Rome, seven thousand five hundred, over.\u201d\n\nInitial Contact When Your Transmitting and Receiving Frequencies are Different.\n\nIf you are attempting to establish contact with a ground station and you are receiving on a different frequency than that transmitted, indicate the VOR name or the frequency on which you expect a reply. Most FSSs and control facilities can transmit on several VOR stations in the area. Use the appropriate FSS call sign as indicated on charts.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nNew York FSS transmits on the Kennedy, the Hampton, and the Calverton VORTACs. If you are in the Calverton area, your callup should be \u201cNew York radio, Cessna Three One Six Zero Foxtrot, receiving Calverton V-O-R, over.\u201d\n\nIf the chart indicates FSS frequencies above the VORTAC or in the FSS communications boxes, transmit or receive on those frequencies nearest your location.\n\nWhen unable to establish contact and you wish to call any ground station, use the phrase \u201cANY RADIO (tower) (station), GIVE CESSNA THREE ONE SIX ZERO FOXTROT A CALL ON (frequency) OR (V-O-R).\u201d If an emergency exists or you need assistance, so state.\n\nSubsequent Contacts and Responses to Callup from a Ground Facility.\nUse the same format as used for the initial contact except you should state your message or request with the callup in one transmission. The ground station name and the word \u201cOver\u201d may be omitted if the message requires an obvious reply and there is no possibility for misunderstandings. You should acknowledge all callups or clearances unless the controller or FSS specialist advises otherwise. There are some occasions when controllers must issue time\u2010critical instructions to other aircraft, and they may be in a position to observe your response, either visually or on radar. If the situation demands your response, take appropriate action or immediately advise the facility of any problem. Acknowledge with your aircraft identification, either at the beginning or at the end of your transmission, and one of the words \u201cWilco,\u201d \u201cRoger,\u201d \u201cAffirmative,\u201d \u201cNegative,\u201d or other appropriate remarks; e.g., \u201cPIPER TWO ONE FOUR LIMA, ROGER.\u201d If you have been receiving services; e.g., VFR traffic advisories and you are leaving the area or changing frequencies, advise the ATC facility and terminate contact.\nAcknowledgement of Frequency Changes.\n\nWhen advised by ATC to change frequencies, acknowledge the instruction. If you select the new frequency without an acknowledgement, the controller's workload is increased because there is no way of knowing whether you received the instruction or have had radio communications failure.\n\n\nAt times, a controller/specialist may be working a sector with multiple frequency assignments. In order to eliminate unnecessary verbiage and to free the controller/specialist for higher priority transmissions, the controller/specialist may request the pilot \u201c(Identification), change to my frequency 134.5.\u201d This phrase should alert the pilot that the controller/specialist is only changing frequencies, not controller/specialist, and that initial callup phraseology may be abbreviated.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cUnited Two Twenty-Two on one three four point five\u201d or \u201cone three four point five, United Two Twenty-Two.\u201d\nCompliance with Frequency Changes.\nWhen instructed by ATC to change frequencies, select the new frequency as soon as possible unless instructed to make the change at a specific time, fix, or altitude. A delay in making the change could result in an untimely receipt of important information. If you are instructed to make the frequency change at a specific time, fix, or altitude, monitor the frequency you are on until reaching the specified time, fix, or altitudes unless instructed otherwise by ATC.\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-3-1, ARTCC Communications."

                "section-content": "Precautions in the Use of Call Signs.\n\nImproper use of call signs can result in pilots executing a clearance intended for another aircraft. Call signs should never be abbreviated on an initial contact or at any time when other aircraft call signs have similar numbers/sounds or identical letters/number; e.g., Cessna 6132F, Cessna 1622F, Baron\u2009123F, Cherokee 7732F, etc.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nAssume that a controller issues an approach clearance to an aircraft at the bottom of a holding stack and an aircraft with a similar call sign (at the top of the stack) acknowledges the clearance with the last two or three numbers of the aircraft's call sign. If the aircraft at the bottom of the stack did not hear the clearance and intervene, flight safety would be affected, and there would be no reason for either the controller or pilot to suspect that anything is wrong. This kind of \u201chuman factors\u201d error can strike swiftly and is extremely difficult to rectify.\n\nPilots, therefore, must be certain that aircraft identification is complete and clearly identified before taking action on an ATC clearance. ATC specialists will not abbreviate call signs of air carrier or other civil aircraft having authorized call signs. ATC specialists may initiate abbreviated call signs of other aircraft by using the prefix and the last three digits/letters of the aircraft identification after communications are established. The pilot may use the abbreviated call sign in subsequent contacts with the ATC specialist. When aware of similar/identical call signs, ATC specialists will take action to minimize errors by emphasizing certain numbers/letters, by repeating the entire call sign, by repeating the prefix, or by asking pilots to use a different call sign temporarily. Pilots should use the phrase \u201cVERIFY CLEARANCE FOR (your complete call sign)\u201d if doubt exists concerning proper identity.\n\nCivil aircraft pilots should state the aircraft type, model or manufacturer's name, followed by the digits/letters of the registration number. When the aircraft manufacturer's name or model is stated, the prefix \u201cN\u201d is dropped; e.g., Aztec Two Four Six Four Alpha.\n\nEXAMPLE-Bonanza Six Five Five Golf.Breezy Six One Three Romeo Experimental (omit \u201cExperimental\u201d after initial contact).\nAir Taxi or other commercial operators not having FAA authorized call signs should prefix their normal identification with the phonetic word \u201cTango.\u201d\n\nEXAMPLE-\nTango Aztec Two Four Six Four Alpha.\nAir carriers and commuter air carriers having FAA authorized call signs should identify themselves by stating the complete call sign (using group form for the numbers) and the word \u201csuper\u201d or \u201cheavy\u201d if appropriate.\n\nEXAMPLE-United Twenty-Five Heavy.Midwest Commuter Seven Eleven.\nMilitary aircraft use a variety of systems including serial numbers, word call signs, and combinations of letters/numbers. Examples include Army Copter 48931; Air Force 61782; REACH 31792; Pat 157; Air Evac 17652; Navy Golf Alfa Kilo\u200921; Marine 4 Charlie 36, etc.\n\n\nAir Ambulance Flights.\nBecause of the priority afforded air ambulance flights in the ATC system, extreme discretion is necessary when using the term \u201cMEDEVAC.\u201d It is only intended for those missions of an urgent medical nature and to be utilized only for that portion of the flight requiring priority handling. It is important for ATC to be aware of a flight's MEDEVAC status, and it is the pilot's responsibility to ensure that this information is provided to ATC.\nTo receive priority handling from ATC, the pilot must verbally identify the flight in radio transmissions by stating \u201cMEDEVAC\u201d followed by the FAA authorized call sign (ICAO 3LD, US Special, or local) or the aircraft civil \u201cN\u201d registration numbers/letters.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nIf the aircraft identification of the flight indicates DAL51, the pilot states \u201cMEDEVAC Delta Fifty One.\u201d\nIf the aircraft identification of the flight indicates MDSTR1, the pilot states \u201cMEDEVAC Medstar One.\u201d\nIf the aircraft identification of the flight indicates N123G or LN123G, the pilot states \u201cMEDEVAC One Two Three Golf\u201d.\n\nIf requested by the pilot, ATC will provide additional assistance (e.g., landline notifications) to expedite ground handling of patients, vital organs, or urgently needed medical materials. When possible make these requests to ATC via methods other than through ATC radio frequencies.\n\nMEDEVAC flights may include:\n\nCivilian air ambulance flights responding to medical emergencies (e.g., first call to an accident scene, carrying patients, organ donors, organs, or other urgently needed lifesaving medical material).\n\n\nAir carrier and air taxi flights responding to medical emergencies. The nature of these medical emergency flights usually concerns the transportation of urgently needed lifesaving medical materials or vital organs, but can include inflight medical emergencies. It is imperative that the company/pilot determine, by the nature/urgency of the specific medical cargo, if priority ATC assistance is required.\n\nWhen filing a flight plan, pilots may include \u201cL\u201d for MEDEVAC with the aircraft registration letters/digits and/or include \u201cMEDEVAC\u201d in Item 11 (Remarks) of the flight plan or Item 18 (Other Information) of an international flight plan. However, ATC will only use these flight plan entries for informational purposes or as a visual indicator. ATC will only provide priority handling when the pilot verbally identifies the \u201cMEDEVAC\u201d status of the flight as described in subparagraph b1 above.\n\nNOTE-\nCivilian air ambulance aircraft operating VFR and without a filed flight plan are eligible for priority handling in accordance with subparagraph b1 above.\n\nATC will also provide priority handling to HOSP and AIR EVAC flights when verbally requested. These aircraft may file \u201cHOSP\u201d or \u201cAIR EVAC\u201d in either Item 11 (Remarks) of the flight plan or Item 18 of an international flight plan. For aircraft identification in radio transmissions, civilian pilots will use normal call signs when filing \u201cHOSP\u201d and military pilots will use the \u201cEVAC\u201d call sign.\n\nStudent Pilots Radio Identification.\n\nThe FAA desires to help student pilots in acquiring sufficient practical experience in the environment in which they will be required to operate. To receive additional assistance while operating in areas of concentrated air traffic, student pilots need only identify themselves as a student pilot during their initial call to an FAA radio facility.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nDayton tower, Fleetwing One Two Three Four, student pilot.\n\nThis special identification will alert FAA ATC personnel and enable them to provide student pilots with such extra assistance and consideration as they may need. It is recommended that student pilots identify themselves as such, on initial contact with each clearance delivery prior to taxiing, ground control, tower, approach and departure control frequency, or FSS contact."

Baro-VNAV equipped aircraft without a temperature compensating system may not use the RNAV (GPS) approach LNAV/VNAV line of minima when the actual temperature is above or below the charted temperature range.\n\n\nThe uncompensated baro-VNAV chart note and temperature range on an RNAV (RNP) approach applies to the entire procedure. For aircraft without a baro-VNAV and temperature compensating system, the RNAV (RNP) approach is not authorized when the actual temperature is above or below the charted uncompensated baro-VNAV temperature range.\n\n\nBaro-VNAV temperature range versus CTA temperature: The baro-VNAV and CTA temperatures are independent and do not follow the same correction or reporting procedures. However, there are times when both procedures, each according to its associated temperature, should be accomplished on the approach.\n\nOperating and ATC reporting procedures.\n\nDo not use the CTA operating or reporting procedure found in this section, 7-3-4a thru 7-3-5e when complying with the baro-VNAV temperature note on an RNAV (GPS) approach. Correction is not required nor expected to be applied to procedure altitudes or VNAV paths outside of the final approach segment.\n\n\nOperators must advise ATC when making temperature corrections on RNP authorization required (AR) approaches while adhering to baro-VNAV temperature note.\n\nReporting altitude corrections is required when complying with CTAs in conjunction with the baro-VNAV temperature note. The CTA altitude corrections will be reported in this situation. No altitude correction reporting is required in the final segment.\n\nNOTE-\nWhen executing an approach with vertical guidance at a CTA (i.e., ILS, localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV), LNAV/VNAV), pilots are reminded to intersect the glideslope/glidepath at the corrected intermediate altitude (if applicable) and follow the published glideslope/glidepath to the corrected minima. The ILS glideslope and WAAS generated glidepath are unaffected by cold temperatures and provide vertical guidance to the corrected DA. Begin descent on the ILS glideslope or WAAS generated glidepath when directed by aircraft instrumentation. Temperature affects the precise final approach fix (PFAF) true altitude where a baro-VNAV generated glidepath begins. The PFAF altitude must be corrected when below the CTA temperature restriction for the intermediate segment or outside of the baro-VNAV temperature restriction when using the LNAV/VNAV line of minima to the corrected DA."

An airport that is determined to be at risk will have an ICON and temperature published on the instrument approach procedure (IAP) in the terminal procedures publication (TPP).\n\n\nCTA identification in TPP: A CTA is identified by a \u201csnowflake\u201d icon ( ) and temperature limit, in Celsius, on U.S. Government approach charts.\n\nA current list of CTAs is located at:  https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dtpp/search/.

The CTA risk analysis is performed on airports that have at least one runway of 2500 ft. Pilots operating into an airport with a runway length less than 2500 ft may make a cold temperature altitude correction in cold temperature conditions, if desired. Comply with operating and reporting procedures for CTAs.\n\nATC Reporting Requirements. Pilots must advise ATC with the corrected altitude when applying an altitude correction on any approach segment with the exception of the final segment.\n\nMethods to apply correction: The FAA recommends operators/pilots use either the All Segments Method or the Individual Segments Method when making corrections at CTAs."

                "section-content": "PILOTS MUST NOT MAKE AN ALTIMETER CHANGE to accomplish an altitude correction. Pilots must ensure that the altimeter is set to the current altimeter setting provided by ATC in accordance with 14 CFR \u00a791.121.\n\n\nActions on when and where to make corrections: Pilots will make an altitude correction to the published, \u201cat\u201d, \u201cat or above\u201d, and \u201cat or below\u201d altitudes on all designated segment(s) to all runways for all published instrument approach procedures when the reported airport temperature is at or below the published CTA temperature on the approach plate. A pilot may request an altitude correction (if desired) on any approach at any United States airport when extreme cold temperature is encountered. Pilots making a correction must comply with ATC reporting requirements.\n\nCorrectable altitudes: ATC does not apply a cold temperature correction to their Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) or Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) charts. Pilots must request approval from ATC to apply a cold temperature correction to any ATC assigned altitude. Pilots must not correct altitudes published on Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs), Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODPs), and Standard Terminal Arrivals (STARs).\n\nUse of corrected MDA/DA: Pilots will use the corrected MDA or DA as the minimum altitude for an approach. Pilots must meet the requirements in 14 CFR Part 91.175 in order to operate below the corrected MDA or DA. Pilots must see and avoid obstacles when descending below the minimum altitude on the approach.\n\nNOTE-\nThe corrected DA or MDA does not affect the visibility minima published for the approach. With the application of a cold temperature correction to the DA or MDA, the airplane should be in a position on the glideslope/glidepath or at the published missed approach point to identify the runway environment.\n\nAcceptable use of the table for manual CTA altitude correction (see TBL 7-3-1): Pilots may calculate a correction with a visual interpolation of the chart when using reported temperature and height above airport. This calculated altitude correction may then be rounded to the nearest whole hundred or rounded up. For example, a correction of 130 ft from the chart may be rounded to 100 ft or 200 ft. A correction of 280 ft will be rounded up to 300 ft. This rounded correction will be added to the appropriate altitudes for the \u201cIndividual\u201d or \u201cAll\u201d segment method. The correction calculated from the table for the MDA or DA may be used as is or rounded up, but never rounded down. This number will be added to the MDA, DA, and all step\u2010down fix altitudes inside of the FAF/PFAF.\n\nNo extrapolation above the 5000 ft column is required. Pilots may use the 5000 ft \u201cheight above airport in feet\u201d column for calculating corrections when the calculated altitude is greater than 5000 ft above reporting station elevation. Pilots must add the correction(s) from the table to the affected segment altitude(s) and fly at the new corrected altitude. Do not round down when using the 5000 ft column for calculated height above airport values greater than 5000 ft. Pilots may extrapolate above the 5000 ft column to apply a correction if desired.\n\n\nThese techniques have been adopted to minimize pilot distraction by limiting the number of entries into the table when making corrections. Although not all altitudes on the approach will be corrected back to standard day values, a safe distance above the terrain/obstacle will be maintained on the corrected approach segment(s). Pilots may calculate a correction for each fix based on the fix altitude if desired.\n\nNOTE-\nPilots may use Real Time Mesoscale Analysis (RTMA): Alternate Report of Surface Temperature, for computing altitude corrections, when airport temperatures are not available via normal reporting.\n\nHow to apply Cold Temperature Altitude Corrections on an Approach.\n\nAll Segments Method: Pilots may correct all segment altitudes from the IAF altitude to the MA final holding altitude. Pilots familiar with the information in this section and the procedures for accomplishing the all segments method, only need to use the published \u201csnowflake\u201d icon,  /CTA temperature limit on the approach chart for making corrections. Pilots are not required to reference the CTA list. The altitude correction is calculated as follows:\n\nManual correction: Pilots will make a manual correction when the aircraft is not equipped with a temperature compensating system or when a compensating system is not used to make the correction. Use TBL 7-3-1, ICAO Cold Temperature Error Table, to calculate the correction needed for the approach segment(s).\n\nCorrect all altitudes from the FAF/PFAF up to and including the IAF altitude: Calculate the correction by taking the FAF/PFAF altitude and subtracting the airport elevation. Use this number to enter the height above airport column in TBL 7-3-1 until reaching the reported temperature from the \u201cReported Temperature\u201d row. Round this number as applicable and then add to all altitudes from the FAF altitude through the IAF altitude.\n\n\nCorrect all altitudes in the final segment: Calculate the correction by taking the MDA or DA for the approach being flown and subtract the airport elevation. Use this number to enter the height above airport column in TBL 7-3-1 until reaching the reported temperature from the \u201cReported Temperature\u201d row. Use this number or round up to next nearest 100 ft. Add this number to MDA or DA, and any step-down fix altitudes in the final segment.\n\nCorrect final holding altitude in the MA Segment: Calculate the correction by taking the MA holding altitude and subtract the airport elevation. Use this number to enter the height above airport column in TBL 7-3-1 until reaching the reported temperature from the \u201cReported Temperature\u201d row. Round this number as applicable and then add to the final MA altitude only.\n\n\nAircraft with temperature compensating systems: If flying an aircraft equipped with a system capable of temperature compensation, follow the instructions for applying temperature compensation provided in the airplane flight manual (AFM), AFM supplement, or system operating manual. Ensure that temperature compensation system is on and active prior to the IAF and remains active throughout the entire approach and missed approach.\n\nPilots that have a system that is able to calculate a temperature\u2010corrected DA or MDA may use the system for this purpose.\n\n\nPilots that have a system unable to calculate a temperature corrected DA or MDA will manually calculate an altitude correction for the MDA or DA.\n\nNOTE-\nSome systems apply temperature compensation only to those altitudes associated with an instrument approach procedure loaded into the active flight plan, while other systems apply temperature compensation to all procedure altitudes or user entered altitudes in the active flight plan, including altitudes associated with a Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR). For those systems that apply temperature compensation to all altitudes in the active flight plan, delay activating temperature compensation until the aircraft has passed the last altitude constraint associated with the active STAR.\n\n\nIndividual Segment(s) Method: Pilots are allowed to correct only the marked segment(s) indicated in the CTA list (https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dtpp/search/). Pilots using the Individual Segment(s) Method will reference the CTA list to determine which segment(s) need a correction.

Use TBL 7-3-1, ICAO Cold Temperature Error Table, to calculate the correction needed for the approach segment(s).\n\nInitial Segment: All altitudes from the intermediate fix (IF) altitude up to and including the IAF altitude. The correction may be accomplished by using the IF altitude or by using the All Segments Method (a) Manual correction (1). To correct the initial segment by using the IF altitude, subtract the airport elevation from the IF altitude. Use this number to enter the height above airport column in TBL 7-3-1 until reaching the reported temperature from the \u201cReported Temperature\u201d row. Round this number as applicable and then add to the IF, IAF, and any step\u2010down fix altitudes.\n\n\nIntermediate Segment: All altitudes from the FAF/PFAF up to but not including the IF altitude. Calculate the correction by taking FAF/PFAF altitude and subtracting the airport elevation. Use this number to enter the height above airport column in TBL 7-3-1 until reaching the reported temperature from the \u201cReported Temperature\u201d row. Round this number as applicable and then add to FAF altitude and all step\u2010down fix altitudes within the intermediate segment (inside of the waypoint labeled \u201cIF\u201d).\n\nFinal segment: Calculate the correction by taking the MDA or DA for the approach flown and subtract the airport elevation. Use this number to enter the height above airport column in TBL 7-3-1 until reaching the reported temperature from the \u201cReported Temperature\u201d row. Use this number or round up to next nearest 100 ft. Add this number to MDA or DA and any applicable step\u2010down fix altitudes in the final segment.\n\nMissed Approach Segment: Calculate the correction by taking the final MA holding altitude and subtract the airport elevation. Use this number to enter the height above airport column in TBL 7-3-1 until reaching the reported temperature from the \u201cReported Temperature\u201d row. Round this number as applicable and then add to the final MA altitude only.\n\n\nAircraft with temperature compensating system: If flying an aircraft equipped with a system capable of temperature compensation, follow the instructions for applying temperature compensation provided in the AFM, AFM supplement, or system operating manual. Ensure the temperature compensation system is on and active prior to the segment(s) being corrected. Manually calculate an altimetry correction for the MDA or DA. Determine an altimetry correction from the ICAO table based on the reported airport temperature and the height difference between the MDA or DA, as applicable, and the airport elevation, or use the compensating system to calculate a temperature corrected altitude for the published MDA or DA if able.\n\nCommunication: Pilots must request approval from ATC whenever applying a cold temperature altitude correction. Pilots do not need to inform ATC of the final approach segment correction (i.e., new MDA or DA). This request should be made on initial radio contact with the ATC facility issuing the approach clearance. ATC requires this information in order to ensure appropriate vertical separation between known traffic. Pilots should query ATC when vectored altitudes to a segment are lower than the requested corrected altitude. Pilots are encouraged to self-announce corrected altitude when flying into a non-towered airfield.\n\nThe following are examples of appropriate pilot-to-ATC communication when applying cold-temperature altitude corrections.\n\nOn initial check-in with ATC providing approach clearance: Missoula, MT (example below).\n\u2022 Vectors to final approach course: Outside of IAFs: \u201cRequest 9700 ft for cold temperature operations.\u201d\u2022 Vectors to final approach course: Inside of ODIRE: \u201cRequest 7300 ft for cold temperature operations.\u201d\u2022 Missed Approach segment: \u201cRequire final holding altitude, 12500 ft on missed approach for cold temperature operations.\u201d\n\nPilots cleared by ATC for an instrument approach procedure; \u201cCleared the RNAV (GPS) Y RWY 12 approach (from any IAF)\u201d.

The policies, guidance and direction in this section apply to RVSM operations in the airspace over the lower 48 states, Alaska, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico High Offshore Airspace and airspace in the San Juan FIR where VHF or UHF voice direct controller-pilot communication (DCPC) is normally available. Policies, guidance and direction for RVSM operations in oceanic airspace where VHF or UHF voice DCPC is not available and the airspace of other countries can be found in the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), Part II- En Route, ENR 1. General Rules and Procedures, and ENR 7.Oceanic Operations.\n\n\nRequirement. The FAA implemented RVSM between flight level\u2009(FL) 290-410 (inclusive) in the following airspace: the airspace of the lower 48 states of the United States, Alaska, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico High Offshore Airspace and the San Juan FIR. RVSM has been implemented worldwide and may be applied in all ICAO Flight Information Regions (FIR).\n\nRVSM Authorization. In accordance with 14\u2009CFR Section 91.180, with only limited exceptions, prior to operating in RVSM airspace, operators must comply with the standards of Part 91, Appendix G, and be authorized by the Administrator. If either the operator or the operator's aircraft have not met the applicable RVSM standards, the aircraft will be referred to as a \u201cnon-RVSM\u201d aircraft. Paragraph 4-6-10 discusses ATC policies for accommodation of non-RVSM aircraft flown by the Department of Defense, Air Ambulance (MEDEVAC) operators, foreign State governments and aircraft flown for certification and development. Paragraph 4-6-11, \u2009Non-RVSM Aircraft Requesting Climb to and Descent from Flight Levels Above RVSM Airspace Without Intermediate Level Off, contains policies for non-RVSM aircraft climbing and descending through RVSM airspace to/from flight levels above RVSM airspace.\n\nBenefits. RVSM enhances ATC flexibility, mitigates conflict points, enhances sector throughput, reduces controller workload and enables crossing traffic. Operators gain fuel savings and operating efficiency benefits by flying at more fuel efficient flight levels and on more user preferred routings."

For Domestic RVSM operations, an operator may choose to operate under the provisions of Part 91, Appendix\u2009G, Section 9; or if intending to operate outside U.S. airspace, hold a specific approval (OpSpec/MSpec/LOA) under the provisions of Section 3 of Part 91, Appendix G.\n\n\nSources of Information. Advisory Circular (AC) 91-85, Authorization of Aircraft and Operators for Flight in Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace, and the FAA RVSM website.\n\nTCAS Equipage. TCAS equipage requirements are contained in 14 CFR Sections 121.356, 125.224, 129.18 and 135.189. Part 91, Appendix G, does not contain TCAS equipage requirements specific to RVSM, however, Appendix G does require that aircraft equipped with TCAS II and flown in RVSM airspace be modified to incorporate TCAS\u2009II Version 7.0 or a later version.\n\nAircraft Monitoring. Operators are required to participate in the RVSM altitude-keeping performance monitoring program that is appropriate for the type of operation being conducted. The monitoring programs are described in AC 91-85. Monitoring is a quality control program that enables the FAA and other civil aviation authorities to assess the in-service altitude-keeping performance of aircraft and operators.\n\nPurpose of RVSM Approvals Databases. All RVSM designated airspace is monitored airspace. ATC does not use RVSM approvals databases to determine whether or not a clearance can be issued into RVSM airspace. RVSM program managers do regularly review the operators and aircraft that operate in RVSM airspace to identify and investigate those aircraft and operators flying in RVSM airspace, but not listed on the RVSM approvals databases.\n\nRegistration of U.S. Operators. When U.S. operators and aircraft are granted specific RVSM authority, the Separation Standards Group at the FAA Technical Center obtains PTRS operator and aircraft information to update the FAA maintained U.S. Operator/Aircraft RVSM Approvals database. Basic database operator and aircraft information can be viewed on the RVSM Documentation web page in the \u201cRVSM Approvals\u201d section."

                "section-title": "Guidance on Severe Turbulence and Mountain Wave Activity (MWA)",
                "section-content": "Introduction/Explanation\n\nThe information and practices in this paragraph are provided to emphasize to pilots and controllers the importance of taking appropriate action in RVSM airspace when aircraft experience severe turbulence and/or MWA that is of sufficient magnitude to significantly affect altitude-keeping.\n\n\nSevere Turbulence. Severe turbulence causes large, abrupt changes in altitude and/or attitude usually accompanied by large variations in indicated airspeed. Aircraft may be momentarily out of control. Encounters with severe turbulence must be remedied immediately in any phase of flight. Severe turbulence may be associated with MWA.\n\nMountain Wave Activity (MWA)\n\nSignificant MWA occurs both below and above the floor of RVSM airspace, FL 290. MWA often occurs in western states in the vicinity of mountain ranges. It may occur when strong winds blow perpendicular to mountain ranges resulting in up and down or wave motions in the atmosphere. Wave action can produce altitude excursions and airspeed fluctuations accompanied by only light turbulence. With sufficient amplitude, however, wave action can induce altitude and airspeed fluctuations accompanied by severe turbulence. MWA is difficult to forecast and can be highly localized and short lived.\n\n\nWave activity is not necessarily limited to the vicinity of mountain ranges. Pilots experiencing wave activity anywhere that significantly affects altitude-keeping can follow the guidance provided below.\n\nInflight MWA Indicators (Including Turbulence). Indicators that the aircraft is being subjected to MWA are:\n\nAltitude excursions and/or airspeed fluctuations with or without associated turbulence.\n\n\nPitch and trim changes required to maintain altitude with accompanying airspeed fluctuations.\n\nLight to severe turbulence depending on the magnitude of the MWA.\n\nPriority for Controller Application of Merging Target Procedures\n\nExplanation of Merging Target Procedures. As described in subparagraph c3 below, ATC will use \u201cmerging target procedures\u201d to mitigate the effects of both severe turbulence and MWA. The procedures in subparagraph c3 have been adapted from existing procedures published in FAA Order\u2009JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, paragraph\u20095-1-4, Merging Target Procedures. Paragraph\u20095-1-4 calls for en route controllers to advise pilots of potential traffic that they perceive may fly directly above or below his/her aircraft at minimum vertical separation. In response, pilots are given the option of requesting a radar vector to ensure their radar target will not merge or overlap with the traffic's radar target.\n\n\nThe provision of \u201cmerging target procedures\u201d to mitigate the effects of severe turbulence and/or MWA is not optional for the controller, but rather is a priority responsibility. Pilot requests for vectors for traffic avoidance when encountering MWA or pilot reports of \u201cUnable RVSM due turbulence or MWA\u201d are considered first priority aircraft separation and sequencing responsibilities. (FAA Order JO 7110.65, paragraph 2-1-2, Duty Priority, states that the controller's first priority is to separate aircraft and issue safety alerts).\n\nExplanation of the term \u201ctraffic permitting.\u201d The contingency actions for MWA and severe turbulence detailed in paragraph 4-6-9, Contingency Actions: Weather Encounters and Aircraft System Failures that Occur After Entry into RVSM Airspace, state that the controller will \u201cvector aircraft to avoid merging targets with traffic at adjacent flight levels, traffic permitting.\u201d The term \u201ctraffic permitting\u201d is not intended to imply that merging target procedures are not a priority duty. The term is intended to recognize that, as stated in FAA Order\u2009JO\u20097110.65, paragraph 2-1-2, Duty Priority, there are circumstances when the controller is required to perform more than one action and must \u201cexercise their best judgment based on the facts and circumstances known to them\u201d to prioritize their actions. Further direction given is: \u201cThat action which is most critical from a safety standpoint is performed first.\u201d\n\nTCAS Sensitivity. For both MWA and severe turbulence encounters in RVSM airspace, an additional concern is the sensitivity of collision avoidance systems when one or both aircraft operating in close proximity receive TCAS advisories in response to disruptions in altitude hold capability.\n\n\nPre-flight tools. Sources of observed and forecast information that can help the pilot ascertain the possibility of MWA or severe turbulence are:  Forecast Winds and Temperatures Aloft (FD), Area Forecast (FA), Graphical Turbulence Guidance (GTG), SIGMETs and PIREPs.\n\nPilot Actions When Encountering Weather (e.g., Severe Turbulence or MWA)\n\nWeather Encounters Inducing Altitude Deviations of Approximately 200 feet. When the pilot experiences weather induced altitude deviations of approximately 200 feet, the pilot will contact ATC and state \u201cUnable RVSM Due (state reason)\u201d (e.g.,\u2009turbulence, mountain wave). See contingency actions in paragraph 4-6-9.\n\n\nSevere Turbulence (including that associated with MWA). When pilots encounter severe turbulence, they should contact ATC and report the situation. Until the pilot reports clear of severe turbulence, the controller will apply merging target vectors to one or both passing aircraft to prevent their targets from merging:\n\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cYankee 123, FL 310, unable RVSM due severe turbulence.\u201d\n\u201cYankee 123, fly heading 290; traffic twelve o'clock, 10\u2009miles, opposite direction; eastbound MD-80 at FL\u2009320\u201d (or the controller may issue a vector to the MD-80 traffic to avoid Yankee 123).\nMWA. When pilots encounter MWA, they should contact ATC and report the magnitude and location of the wave activity. When a controller makes a merging targets traffic call, the pilot may request a vector to avoid flying directly over or under the traffic. In situations where the pilot is experiencing altitude deviations of 200 feet or greater, the pilot will request a vector to avoid traffic. Until the pilot reports clear of MWA, the controller will apply merging target vectors to one or both passing aircraft to prevent their targets from merging:\n\nEXAMPLE-\n\u201cYankee 123, FL 310, unable RVSM due mountain wave.\u201d\n\u201cYankee 123, fly heading 290; traffic twelve o'clock, 10\u2009miles, opposite direction; eastbound MD-80 at FL\u2009320\u201d (or the controller may issue a vector to the MD-80 traffic to avoid Yankee 123).\nFL Change or Re-route. To leave airspace where MWA or severe turbulence is being encountered, the pilot may request a FL change and/or re-route, if necessary."

If a descent clearance has been received that included a crossing restriction, pilots should expect the controller to issue an altitude to maintain. If the STAR contains published altitude and/or speed restrictions, those restrictions are canceled and pilots will receive an altitude to maintain and, if necessary, a speed.\n\nClearance to \u201cdescend via\u201d authorizes pilots to:\n\nDescend at pilot's discretion to meet published restrictions and laterally navigate on a STAR.\n\n\nWhen cleared to a waypoint depicted on a STAR, to descend from a previously assigned altitude at pilot's discretion to the altitude depicted at that waypoint.\n\nOnce established on the depicted arrival, to descend and to meet all published or assigned altitude and/or speed restrictions.\n\nNOTE-\nWhen otherwise cleared along a route or procedure that contains published speed restrictions, the pilot must comply with those speed restrictions independent of any descend via clearance.ATC anticipates pilots will begin adjusting speed the minimum distance necessary prior to a published speed restriction so as to cross the waypoint/fix at the published speed. Once at the published speed, ATC expects pilots will maintain the published speed until additional adjustment is required to comply with further published or ATC assigned speed restrictions or as required to ensure compliance with 14 CFR Section 91.117.The \u201cdescend via\u201d is used in conjunction with STARs to reduce phraseology by not requiring the controller to restate the altitude at the next waypoint/fix to which the pilot has been cleared.Air traffic will assign an altitude to cross the waypoint/ fix, if no altitude is depicted at the waypoint/fix, for aircraft on a direct routing to a STAR. Air traffic must ensure obstacle clearance when issuing a \u201cdescend via\u201d instruction to the pilot.Minimum en route altitudes (MEA) are not considered restrictions; however, pilots must remain above all MEAs, unless receiving an ATC instruction to descend below the MEA.\n\n\nEXAMPLE-Lateral/routing clearance only.\n\t\u201cCleared Tyler One arrival.\u201d\nNOTE-In Example 1, pilots are cleared to fly the lateral path of the procedure.

RNAV STARs must be retrievable by the procedure name from the aircraft database and conform to charted procedure. As with any ATC clearance or portion thereof, it is the responsibility of each pilot to accept or refuse an issued STAR. Pilots should notify ATC if they do not wish to use a STAR by placing \u201cNO STAR\u201d in the remarks section of the flight plan or by the less desirable method of verbally stating the same to ATC.\n\nSTAR charts are published in the Terminal Procedures Publications (TPP) and are available on subscription from the National Aeronautical Charting Office.\n\nPBN STAR. \n\nPublic PBN STARs are normally designed using RNAV 1, RNP 1, or A-RNP NavSpecs. These procedures require system performance currently met by GPS or DME/DME/IRU PBN systems that satisfy the criteria discussed in AC 90-100A, U.S. Terminal and En Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations. These procedures, using RNAV 1 and RNP 1 NavSpecs, must maintain a total system error of not more than 1 NM for 95% of the total flight time.

The enhancement of safety and reduction of noise is achieved in this program by minimizing low altitude maneuvering of arriving turbojet and turboprop aircraft weighing more than 12,500 pounds and, by permitting departure aircraft to climb to higher altitudes sooner, as arrivals are operating at higher altitudes at the points where their flight paths cross. The application of these procedures also reduces exposure time between controlled aircraft and uncontrolled aircraft at the lower altitudes in and around the terminal environment. Fuel conservation is accomplished by absorbing any necessary arrival delays for aircraft included in this program operating at the higher and more fuel efficient altitudes.\n\n\nA fuel efficient descent is basically an uninterrupted descent (except where level flight is required for speed adjustment) from cruising altitude to the point when level flight is necessary for the pilot to stabilize the aircraft on final approach. The procedure for a fuel efficient descent is based on an altitude loss which is most efficient for the majority of aircraft being served. This will generally result in a descent gradient window of 250-350 feet per nautical mile.\n\nWhen crossing altitudes and speed restrictions are issued verbally or are depicted on a chart, ATC will expect the pilot to descend first to the crossing altitude and then reduce speed. Verbal clearances for descent will normally permit an uninterrupted descent in accordance with the procedure as described in paragraph b above. Acceptance of a charted fuel efficient descent (Runway Profile Descent) clearance requires the pilot to adhere to the altitudes, speeds, and headings depicted on the charts unless otherwise instructed by ATC. PILOTS RECEIVING A CLEARANCE FOR A FUEL EFFICIENT DESCENT ARE EXPECTED TO ADVISE ATC IF THEY DO NOT HAVE RUNWAY PROFILE DESCENT CHARTS PUBLISHED FOR THAT AIRPORT OR ARE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE CLEARANCE."

                "section-content": "Approach control is responsible for controlling all instrument flight operating within its area of responsibility. Approach control may serve one or more airfields, and control is exercised primarily by direct pilot and controller communications. Prior to arriving at the destination radio facility, instructions will be received from ARTCC to contact approach control on a specified frequency.\n\n\nRadar Approach Control.\n\nWhere radar is approved for approach control service, it is used not only for radar approaches (Airport Surveillance Radar [ASR] and Precision Approach Radar [PAR]) but is also used to provide vectors in conjunction with published nonradar approaches based on radio NAVAIDs (ILS, VOR, NDB, TACAN). Radar vectors can provide course guidance and expedite traffic to the final approach course of any established IAP or to the traffic pattern for a visual approach. Approach control facilities that provide this radar service will operate in the following manner:\n\nArriving aircraft are either cleared to an outer fix most appropriate to the route being flown with vertical separation and, if required, given holding information or, when radar handoffs are effected between the ARTCC and approach control, or between two approach control facilities, aircraft are cleared to the airport or to a fix so located that the handoff will be completed prior to the time the aircraft reaches the fix. When radar handoffs are utilized, successive arriving flights may be handed off to approach control with radar separation in lieu of vertical separation.\n\n\nAfter release to approach control, aircraft are vectored to the final approach course (ILS, RNAV, GLS, VOR, ADF, etc.). Radar vectors and altitude or flight levels will be issued as required for spacing and separating aircraft. Therefore, pilots must not deviate from the headings issued by approach control. Aircraft will normally be informed when it is necessary to vector across the final approach course for spacing or other reasons. If approach course crossing is imminent and the pilot has not been informed that the aircraft will be vectored across the final approach course, the pilot should query the controller.\n\nThe pilot is not expected to turn inbound on the final approach course unless an approach clearance has been issued. This clearance will normally be issued with the final vector for interception of the final approach course, and the vector will be such as to enable the pilot to establish the aircraft on the final approach course prior to reaching the final approach fix.\n\nIn the case of aircraft already inbound on the final approach course, approach clearance will be issued prior to the aircraft reaching the final approach fix. When established inbound on the final approach course, radar separation will be maintained and the pilot will be expected to complete the approach utilizing the approach aid designated in the clearance (ILS, RNAV, GLS, VOR, radio beacons, etc.) as the primary means of navigation. Therefore, once established on the final approach course, pilots must not deviate from it unless a clearance to do so is received from ATC.\n\nAfter passing the final approach fix on final approach, aircraft are expected to continue inbound on the final approach course and complete the approach or effect the missed approach procedure published for that airport.\n\n\nARTCCs are approved for and may provide approach control services to specific airports. The radar systems used by these centers do not provide the same precision as an ASR/PAR used by approach control facilities and towers, and the update rate is not as fast. Therefore, pilots may be requested to report established on the final approach course.\n\nWhether aircraft are vectored to the appropriate final approach course or provide their own navigation on published routes to it, radar service is automatically terminated when the landing is completed or when instructed to change to advisory frequency at uncontrolled airports, whichever occurs first."

This information will be broadcast either by a controller or on ATIS. It will not be furnished when the visibility is three miles or better and the ceiling is at or above the highest initial approach altitude established for any low altitude IAP for the airport.\n\n\nThe purpose of this information is to aid the pilot in planning arrival actions; however, it is not an ATC clearance or commitment and is subject to change. Pilots should bear in mind that fluctuating weather, shifting winds, blocked runway, etc., are conditions which may result in changes to approach information previously received. It is important that pilots advise ATC immediately they are unable to execute the approach ATC advised will be used, or if they prefer another type of approach.\n\nAircraft destined to uncontrolled airports, which have automated weather data with broadcast capability, should monitor the ASOS/AWOS frequency to ascertain the current weather for the airport. The pilot must advise ATC when he/she has received the broadcast weather and state his/her intentions.\n\nNOTE-\nASOS/AWOS should be set to provide one-minute broadcast weather updates at uncontrolled airports that are without weather broadcast capability by\u2009a\u2009human observer.Controllers will consider the long line disseminated weather from an automated weather system at an uncontrolled airport as trend and planning information only and will rely on the pilot for current weather information for the airport. If the pilot is unable to receive the current broadcast weather, the last long line disseminated weather will be issued to the pilot. When receiving IFR services, the pilot/aircraft operator is responsible for determining if weather/visibility is adequate for approach/landing.\n\nWhen making an IFR approach to an airport not served by a tower or FSS, after ATC advises \u201cCHANGE TO ADVISORY FREQUENCY APPROVED\u201d you should broadcast your intentions, including the type of approach being executed, your position, and when over the final approach fix inbound (nonprecision approach) or when over the outer marker or fix used in lieu of the outer marker inbound (precision approach).

                "section-content": "14 CFR Section 91.175(a), Instrument approaches to civil airports, requires the use of SIAPs prescribed for the airport in 14 CFR Part 97 unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator (including ATC). If there are military procedures published at a civil airport, aircraft operating under 14 CFR Part\u200991 must use the civil procedure(s). Civil procedures are defined with \u201cFAA\u201d in parenthesis; e.g., (FAA), at the top, center of the procedure chart. DoD procedures are defined using the abbreviation of the applicable military service in parenthesis; e.g., (USAF), (USN), (USA). 14 CFR Section 91.175(g), Military airports, requires civil pilots flying into or out of military airports to comply with the IAPs and takeoff and landing minimums prescribed by the authority having jurisdiction at those airports. Unless an emergency exists, civil aircraft operating at military airports normally require advance authorization, commonly referred to as \u201cPrior Permission Required\u201d or \u201cPPR.\u201d Information on obtaining a PPR for a particular military airport can be found in the Chart Supplement.\n\nNOTE-\nCivil aircraft may conduct practice VFR approaches using DoD instrument approach procedures when approved by the air traffic controller.\n\nIAPs (standard and special, civil and military) are based on joint civil and military criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for TERPS. The design of IAPs based on criteria contained in TERPS, takes into account the interrelationship between airports, facilities, and the surrounding environment, terrain, obstacles, noise sensitivity, etc. Appropriate altitudes, courses, headings, distances, and other limitations are specified and, once approved, the procedures are published and distributed by government and commercial cartographers as instrument approach charts.\n\n\nNot all IAPs are published in chart form. Radar IAPs are established where requirements and facilities exist but they are printed in tabular form in appropriate U.S. Government Flight Information Publications.\n\nThe navigation equipment required to join and fly an instrument approach procedure is indicated by the title of the procedure and notes on the chart.\n\nStraight-in IAPs are identified by the navigational system providing the final approach guidance and the runway to which the approach is aligned (e.g., VOR RWY 13). Circling only approaches are identified by the navigational system providing final approach guidance and a letter (e.g.,\u2009VOR A). More than one navigational system separated by a slash indicates that more than one type of equipment must be used to execute the final approach (e.g., VOR/DME RWY 31). More than one navigational system separated by the word \u201cor\u201d indicates either type of equipment may be used to execute the final approach (e.g., VOR or GPS RWY\u200915).\n\n\nIn some cases, other types of navigation systems including radar may be required to execute other portions of the approach or to navigate to the IAF (e.g., an NDB procedure turn to an ILS, an NDB in the missed approach, or radar required to join the procedure or identify a fix). When radar or other equipment is required for procedure entry from the en\u2009route environment, a note will be charted in the planview of the approach procedure chart (e.g.,\u2009RADAR REQUIRED or ADF REQUIRED). When radar or other equipment is required on portions of the procedure outside the final approach segment, including the missed approach, a note will be charted in the notes box of the pilot briefing portion of the approach chart (e.g., RADAR REQUIRED or DME REQUIRED). Notes are not charted when VOR is required outside the final approach segment. Pilots should ensure that the aircraft is equipped with the required NAVAID(s) in order to execute the approach, including the missed approach.\n\nNOTE-\nSome military (i.e., U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy) IAPs have these \u201cadditional equipment required\" notes charted only in the planview of the approach procedure and do not conform to the same application standards used by the FAA.\n\nThe FAA has initiated a program to provide a new notation for LOC approaches when charted on an ILS approach requiring other navigational aids to fly the final approach course. The LOC minimums will be annotated with the NAVAID required (e.g., \u201cDME Required\u201d or \u201cRADAR Required\u201d). During the transition period, ILS approaches will still exist without the annotation.\n\nMany ILS approaches having minima based on RVR are eligible for a landing minimum of RVR 1800. Some of these approaches are to runways that have touchdown zone and centerline lights. For many runways that do not have touchdown and centerline lights, it is still possible to allow a landing minimum of RVR 1800. For these runways, the normal ILS minimum of RVR 2400 can be annotated with\u2009a single or double asterisk or the dagger symbol \u201c\u2020\u201d; for example \u201c** 696/24 200 (200/1/2).\u201d A note is included on the chart stating\u2009\u201c**RVR 1800 authorized with use of FD or AP or HUD to DA.\u201d The pilot must use the flight director, or autopilot with an approved approach coupler, or head up display to decision altitude or to the initiation of a missed approach. In the interest of safety, single pilot operators should not fly approaches to 1800 RVR minimums on runways without touchdown and centerline lights using only a flight director, unless accompanied by the use of an autopilot with an approach coupler.\n\nThe naming of multiple approaches of the same type to the same runway is also changing. Multiple approaches with the same guidance will be annotated with an alphabetical suffix beginning at the end of the alphabet and working backwards for subsequent procedures (e.g., ILS Z RWY 28, ILS Y RWY 28, etc.). The existing annotations such as ILS\u20092 RWY 28 or Silver ILS RWY 28 will be phased out and replaced with the new designation. The Cat\u2009II and Cat III designations are used to differentiate between multiple ILSs to the same runway unless there are multiples of the same type.\n\nRNAV (GPS) approaches to LNAV, LP, LNAV/VNAV and LPV lines of minima using WAAS and RNAV (GPS) approaches to LNAV and LNAV/VNAV lines of minima using GPS are charted as RNAV (GPS) RWY (Number) (e.g., RNAV (GPS) RWY 21).\n\nPerformance-Based Navigation (PBN) Box. As charts are updated, a procedure's PBN requirements and conventional equipment requirements will be prominently displayed in separate, standardized notes boxes.\u00a0 For procedures with PBN elements, the PBN box will contain the procedure's navigation specification(s); and, if required: specific sensors or infrastructure needed for the navigation solution, any additional or advanced functional requirements, the minimum Required Navigation Performance (RNP) value, and any amplifying remarks. Items listed in this PBN box are REQUIRED for the procedure's PBN elements. For example, an ILS with an RNAV missed approach would require a specific capability to fly the missed approach portion of the procedure. That required capability will be listed in the PBN box. The separate Equipment Requirements box will list ground-based equipment requirements. On procedures with both PBN elements and equipment requirements, the PBN requirements box will be listed first. The publication of these notes will continue incrementally until all charts have been amended to comply with the new standard.\n\nApproach minimums are based on the local altimeter setting for that airport, unless annotated otherwise; e.g., Oklahoma City/Will Rogers World approaches are based on having a Will Rogers World altimeter setting. When a different altimeter source is required, or more than one source is authorized, it will be annotated on the approach chart; e.g., use Sidney altimeter setting, if not received, use Scottsbluff altimeter setting. Approach minimums may be raised when a nonlocal altimeter source is authorized. When more than one altimeter source is authorized, and the minima are different, they will be shown by separate lines in the approach minima box or a note; e.g., use Manhattan altimeter setting; when not available use Salina altimeter setting and increase all MDAs 40\u2009feet. When the altimeter must be obtained from a source other than air traffic a note will indicate the source; e.g., Obtain local altimeter setting on CTAF. When the altimeter setting(s) on which the approach is based is not available, the approach is not authorized. Baro-VNAV must be flown using the local altimeter setting only. Where no local altimeter is available, the LNAV/VNAV line will still be published for use by WAAS receivers with a note that Baro-VNAV is not authorized. When a local and at least one other altimeter setting source is authorized and the local altimeter is not available Baro-VNAV is not authorized; however, the LNAV/VNAV minima can still be used by WAAS receivers using the alternate altimeter setting source.\n\nNOTE-\nBarometric Vertical Navigation (baro-VNAV).  An RNAV system function which uses barometric altitude information from the aircraft's altimeter to compute and present a\u2009vertical guidance path to the pilot. The specified vertical path is computed as a geometric path, typically computed between two waypoints or an angle based computation from a single waypoint.  Further guidance may be found in Advisory Circular 90-105.\n\nA pilot adhering to the altitudes, flight paths, and weather minimums depicted on the IAP chart or vectors and altitudes issued by the radar controller, is assured of terrain and obstruction clearance and runway or airport alignment during approach for landing.\n\nIAPs are designed to provide an IFR descent from the en route environment to a point where a safe landing can be made. They are prescribed and approved by appropriate civil or military authority to ensure a safe descent during instrument flight conditions at a specific airport. It is important that pilots understand these procedures and their use prior to attempting to fly instrument approaches.\n\nTERPS criteria are provided for the following types of instrument approach procedures:\n\nPrecision Approach (PA). An instrument approach based on a navigation system that provides course and glidepath deviation information meeting the precision standards of ICAO Annex 10. For example, PAR, ILS, and GLS are precision approaches.\n\n\nApproach with Vertical Guidance (APV). An instrument approach based on a navigation system that is not required to meet the precision approach standards of ICAO Annex 10 but provides course and glidepath deviation information. For example, Baro-VNAV, LDA with glidepath, LNAV/VNAV and LPV are APV approaches.\n\nNonprecision Approach (NPA). An instrument approach based on a navigation system which provides course deviation information, but no glidepath deviation information. For example, VOR, NDB and LNAV. As noted in subparagraph k, Vertical Descent Angle (VDA) on Nonprecision Approaches, some approach procedures may provide a Vertical Descent Angle as an aid in flying a stabilized approach, without requiring its use in order to fly the procedure. This does not make the approach an APV procedure, since it must still be flown to an MDA and has not been evaluated with a glidepath.\n\n\nThe method used to depict prescribed altitudes on instrument approach charts differs according to techniques employed by different chart publishers. Prescribed altitudes may be depicted in four different configurations: minimum, maximum, mandatory, and recommended. The U.S. Government distributes charts produced by National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and FAA. Altitudes are depicted on these charts in the profile view with underscore, overscore, both or none to identify them as minimum, maximum, mandatory or recommended.\n\nMinimum altitude will be depicted with the altitude value underscored. Aircraft are required to maintain altitude at or above the depicted value, e.g.,\u20093000.\n\n\nMaximum altitude will be depicted with the altitude value overscored. Aircraft are required to maintain altitude at or below the depicted value, e.g.,\u20094000.\n\nMandatory altitude will be depicted with the altitude value both underscored and overscored. Aircraft are required to maintain altitude at the depicted value, e.g., 5000.\n\nRecommended altitude will be depicted with no overscore or underscore. These altitudes are depicted for descent planning, e.g., 6000.\n\nNOTE-\nPilots are cautioned to adhere to altitudes as prescribed because, in certain instances, they may be used as the basis for vertical separation of aircraft by ATC. When a depicted altitude is specified in the ATC clearance, that altitude becomes mandatory as defined above.The ILS glide slope is intended to be intercepted at the published glide slope intercept altitude. This point marks the PFAF and is depicted by the \u201dlightning bolt\u201d symbol on\u2009U.S. Government charts. Intercepting the glide slope at\u2009this altitude marks the beginning of the final approach\u2009segment and ensures required obstacle clearance during descent from the glide slope intercept altitude to the lowest published decision altitude for the\u2009approach.  Interception and tracking of the glide slope prior to the published glide slope interception altitude does\u2009not necessarily ensure that minimum, maximum, and/or mandatory altitudes published for any preceding fixes will\u2009be complied with during the\u2009descent. If the pilot chooses to track the glide slope prior to the glide slope interception altitude, they remain responsible for complying with published altitudes for any preceding stepdown fixes encountered during the subsequent\u2009 descent.Approaches used for simultaneous (parallel) independent and simultaneous close parallel operations procedurally require descending on the glideslope from the altitude at which the approach clearance is issued (refer to 5-4-15 and 5-4-16). For simultaneous close parallel (PRM) approaches, the Attention All Users Page (AAUP) may publish a note which indicates that descending on the glideslope/glidepath meets all crossing restrictions. However, if no such note is published, and for simultaneous independent approaches (4300 and greater runway separation) where an AAUP is not published, pilots are cautioned to monitor their descent on the glideslope/path outside of the PFAF to ensure compliance with published crossing restrictions during simultaneous operations.When parallel approach courses are less than 2500 feet apart and reduced in-trail spacing is authorized for simultaneous dependent operations, a chart note will indicate that simultaneous operations require use of vertical guidance and that the pilot should maintain last assigned altitude until established on glide slope. \u00a0These approaches procedurally require utilization of the ILS glide slope for wake turbulence mitigation.\u00a0Pilots should not confuse these simultaneous dependent operations with (SOIA) simultaneous close parallel PRM approaches, where PRM appears in the approach title.\n\nAltitude restrictions depicted at stepdown fixes within the final approach segment are applicable only when flying a Non-Precision Approach to a straight-in or circling line of minima identified as an MDA (H). These altitude restrictions may be annotated with a note \u201cLOC only\u201d or \u201cLNAV only.\u201d Stepdown fix altitude restrictions within the final approach segment do not apply to pilots using Precision Approach (ILS) or Approach with Vertical Guidance (LPV, LNAV/VNAV) lines of minima identified as a DA(H), since obstacle clearance on these approaches is based on the aircraft following the applicable vertical guidance. Pilots are responsible for adherence to stepdown fix altitude restrictions when outside the final approach segment (i.e., initial or intermediate segment), regardless of which type of procedure the pilot is flying. (See FIG 5-4-1.)\n\nThe Minimum Safe Altitudes (MSA) is published for emergency use on IAP or departure procedure (DP) graphic charts. MSAs provide 1,000 feet of clearance over all obstacles, but do not necessarily assure acceptable navigation signal coverage. The MSA depiction on the plan view of an approach chart or on a DP graphic chart contains the identifier of the center point of the MSA, the applicable radius of the MSA, a depiction of the sector(s), and the minimum altitudes above mean sea level which provide obstacle clearance. For conventional navigation systems, the MSA is normally based on the primary omnidirectional facility on which the IAP or DP graphic chart is predicated, but may be based on the airport reference point (ARP) if no suitable facility is available. For RNAV approaches or DP graphic charts, the MSA is based on an RNAV waypoint. MSAs normally have a 25 NM radius; however, for conventional navigation systems, this radius may be expanded to 30 NM if necessary to encompass the airport landing surfaces. A single sector altitude is normally established, however when the MSA is based on a facility and it is necessary to obtain relief from obstacles, an MSA with up to four sectors may be established.\nFIG 5-4-1Instrument Approach Procedure Stepdown Fixes\n\nTerminal Arrival Area (TAA)\n\nThe TAA provides a transition from the en route structure to the terminal environment with little required pilot/air traffic control interface for aircraft equipped with Area Navigation (RNAV) systems. A TAA provides minimum altitudes with standard obstacle clearance when operating within the TAA boundaries. TAAs are primarily used on RNAV approaches but may be used on an ILS approach when RNAV is the sole means for navigation to the IF; however, they are not normally used in areas of heavy concentration of air traffic.\n\n\nThe basic design of the RNAV procedure underlying the TAA is normally the \u201cT\u201d design (also called the \u201cBasic T\u201d). The \u201cT\u201d design incorporates two IAFs plus a dual purpose IF/IAF that functions as both an intermediate fix and an initial approach fix. The T configuration continues from the IF/IAF to the final approach fix (FAF) and then to the missed approach point (MAP). The two base leg IAFs are typically aligned in a straight-line perpendicular to the intermediate course connecting at the IF/IAF. A Hold-in-Lieu-of Procedure Turn (HILPT) is anchored at the IF/IAF and depicted on U.S. Government publications using the \u201chold-in-lieu -of-PT\u201d holding pattern symbol. When the HILPT is necessary for course alignment and/or descent, the dual purpose IF/IAF serves as an IAF during the entry into the pattern. Following entry into the HILPT pattern and when flying a route or sector labeled \u201cNoPT,\" the dual-purpose fix serves as an IF, marking the beginning of the Intermediate Segment. See FIG 5-4-2 and FIG 5-4-3 for the Basic \u201cT\u201d TAA configuration.\nFIG 5-4-2Basic \u201cT\u201d Design\nFIG 5-4-3Basic \u201cT\u201d Design\n\nThe standard TAA based on the \u201cT\u201d design consists of three areas defined by the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) legs and the intermediate segment course beginning at the IF/IAF. These areas are called the straight-in, left-base, and right-base areas. (See FIG 5-4-4). TAA area lateral boundaries are identified by magnetic courses TO the IF/IAF. The straight-in area can be further divided into pie-shaped sectors with the boundaries identified by magnetic courses TO the (IF/ IAF), and may contain stepdown sections defined by arcs based on RNAV distances from the IF/IAF. (See FIG 5-4-5). The right/left-base areas can only be subdivided using arcs based on RNAV distances from the IAFs for those areas.\nFIG 5-4-4TAA Area\n\nEntry from the terminal area onto the procedure is normally accomplished via a no procedure turn (NoPT) routing or via a course reversal maneuver. The published procedure will be annotated \u201cNoPT\u201d to indicate when the course reversal is not authorized when flying within a particular TAA sector. Otherwise, the pilot is expected to execute the course reversal under the provisions of 14 CFR Section 91.175. The pilot may elect to use the course reversal pattern when it is not required by the procedure, but must receive clearance from air traffic control before beginning the procedure.\n\nATC should not  clear an aircraft to the left base leg or right base leg IAF within a TAA at an intercept angle exceeding 90 degrees. Pilots must not execute the HILPT course reversal when the sector or procedure segment is labeled \u201cNoPT.\u201d\n\n\nATC may clear aircraft direct to the fix labeled IF/IAF if the course to the IF/IAF is within the straight-in sector labeled \u201cNoPT\u201d and the intercept angle does not exceed 90 degrees. Pilots are expected to proceed direct to the IF/IAF and accomplish a straight-in approach. Do not execute HILPT course reversal. Pilots are also expected to fly the straight-in approach when ATC provides radar vectors and monitoring to the IF/IAF and issues a \u201cstraight-in\u201d approach clearance; otherwise, the pilot is expected to execute the HILPT course reversal.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-4-6, Approach Clearance.\n\n\nOn rare occasions, ATC may clear the aircraft for an approach at the airport without specifying the approach procedure by name or by a specific approach (for example, \u201ccleared RNAV Runway 34 approach\u201d) without specifying a particular IAF. In either case, the pilot should proceed direct to the IAF or to the IF/IAF associated with the sector that the aircraft will enter the TAA and join the approach course from that point and if required by that sector (i.e., sector is not labeled \u201cNoPT), complete the HILPT course reversal.\n\nNOTE-\nIf approaching with a TO bearing that is on a sector boundary, the pilot is expected to proceed in accordance with a \u201cNoPT\u201d routing unless otherwise instructed by ATC.\n\nAltitudes published within the TAA  replace the MSA altitude. However, unlike MSA altitudes the TAA altitudes are operationally usable altitudes. These altitudes provide at least 1,000 feet of obstacle clearance, more in mountainous areas. It is important that the pilot knows which area of the TAA the aircraft will enter in order to comply with the minimum altitude requirements. The pilot can determine which area of the TAA the aircraft will enter by determining the magnetic bearing of the aircraft TO the fix labeled IF/IAF. The bearing should then be compared to the published lateral boundary bearings that define the TAA areas. Do not use magnetic bearing to the right-base or left-base IAFs to determine position.\n\nAn ATC clearance direct to an IAF or to the IF/IAF without an approach clearance does not authorize a pilot to descend to a lower TAA altitude. If a pilot desires a lower altitude without an approach clearance, request the lower TAA altitude from ATC. Pilots not sure of the clearance should confirm their clearance with ATC or request a specific clearance. Pilots entering the TAA with two-way radio communications failure (14 CFR Section 91.185, IFR Operations: Two-way Radio Communications Failure), must maintain the highest altitude prescribed by Section 91.185(c)(2) until arriving at the appropriate IAF.\n\n\nOnce cleared for the approach, pilots may descend in the TAA sector to the minimum altitude depicted within the defined area/subdivision, unless instructed otherwise by air traffic control. Pilots should plan their descent within the TAA to permit a normal descent from the IF/IAF to the FAF. In FIG 5-4-5, pilots within the left or right-base areas are expected to maintain a minimum altitude of 6,000 feet until within 17 NM of the associated IAF. After crossing the 17 NM arc, descent is authorized to the lower charted altitudes. Pilots approaching from the northwest are expected to maintain a minimum altitude of 6,000 feet, and when within 22 NM of the IF/IAF, descend to a minimum altitude of 2,000 feet MSL until crossing the IF/IAF.\nFIG 5-4-5Sectored TAA Areas\n\nU.S. Government charts depict TAAs using icons located in the plan view outside the depiction of the actual approach procedure. (See FIG 5-4-6). Use of icons is necessary to avoid obscuring any portion of the \u201cT\u201d procedure (altitudes, courses, minimum altitudes, etc.). The icon for each TAA area will be located and oriented on the plan view with respect to the direction of arrival to the approach procedure, and will show all TAA minimum altitudes and sector/radius subdivisions. The IAF for each area of the TAA is included on the icon where it appears on the approach to help the pilot orient the icon to the approach procedure. The IAF name and the distance of the TAA area boundary from the IAF are included on the outside arc of the TAA area icon.\nFIG 5-4-6RNAV (GPS) Approach Chart\n\nTAAs may be modified from the standard size and shape to accommodate operational or ATC requirements. Some areas may be eliminated, while the other areas are expanded. The \u201cT\u201d design may be modified by the procedure designers where required by terrain or ATC considerations. For instance, the \u201cT\u201d design may appear more like a regularly or irregularly shaped \u201cY,\u201d upside down \u201cL,\u201d or an \u201cI.\u201d\n\nFIG 5-4-7 depicts a TAA without a left base leg and right base leg. In this generalized example, pilots approaching on a bearing TO the IF/IAF from 271 clockwise to 089 are expected to execute a course reversal because the amount of turn required at the IF/IAF exceeds 90 degrees. The term \u201cNoPT\u201d will be annotated on the boundary of the TAA icon for the other portion of the TAA.\nFIG 5-4-7TAA with Left and Right Base Areas Eliminated\n\n\nFIG 5-4-8 depicts another TAA modification that pilots may encounter. In this generalized example, the left base area and part of the straight-in area have been eliminated. Pilots operating within the TAA between 210 clockwise to 360 bearing TO the IF/IAF are expected to proceed direct to the IF/IAF and then execute the course reversal in order to properly align the aircraft for entry onto the intermediate segment or to avoid an excessive descent rate. Aircraft operating in areas from 001 clockwise to 090 bearing TO the IF/IAF are expected to proceed direct to the right base IAF and not execute course reversal maneuver. Aircraft cleared direct the IF/IAF by ATC in this sector will be expected to accomplish HILTP. Aircraft operating in areas 091 clockwise to 209 bearing TO the IF/IAF are expected to proceed direct to the IF/IAF and not execute the course reversal. These two areas are annotated \u201cNoPT\u201d at the TAA boundary of the icon in these areas when displayed on the approach chart's plan view.\nFIG 5-4-8TAA with Left Base and Part of Straight-In Area Eliminated\n\nFIG 5-4-9 depicts a TAA with right base leg and part of the straight-in area eliminated.\nFIG 5-4-9TAA with Right Base Eliminated\n\nWhen an airway does not cross the lateral TAA boundaries, a feeder route will be established from an airway fix or NAVAID to the TAA boundary to provide a transition from the en route structure to the appropriate IAF. Each feeder route will terminate at the TAA boundary and will be aligned along a path pointing to the associated IAF. Pilots should descend to the TAA altitude after crossing the TAA boundary and cleared for the approach by ATC. (See FIG 5-4-10).\nFIG 5-4-10Examples of a TAA with Feeders from an Airway\n\nEach waypoint on the \u201cT\u201d is assigned a pronounceable 5-letter name, except the missed approach waypoint. These names are used for ATC communications, RNAV databases, and aeronautical navigation products. The missed approach waypoint is assigned a pronounceable name when it is not located at the runway threshold.\nFIG 5-4-11Minimum Vectoring Altitude Charts\n\nMinimum Vectoring Altitudes (MVAs) are established for use by ATC when radar ATC is exercised. MVA charts are prepared by air traffic facilities at locations where there are numerous different minimum IFR altitudes. Each MVA chart has sectors large enough to accommodate vectoring of aircraft within the sector at the MVA. Each sector boundary is at least 3 miles from the obstruction determining the MVA. To avoid a large sector with an excessively high MVA due to an isolated prominent obstruction, the obstruction may be enclosed in a buffer area whose boundaries are at least 3 miles from the obstruction. This is done to facilitate vectoring around the obstruction. (See FIG 5-4-11.)\n\nThe minimum vectoring altitude in each sector provides 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle in nonmountainous areas and 2,000 feet above the highest obstacle in designated mountainous areas. Where lower MVAs are required in designated mountainous areas to achieve compatibility with terminal routes or to permit vectoring to an IAP, 1,000 feet of obstacle clearance may be authorized with the use of ATC surveillance. The minimum vectoring altitude will provide at least 300 feet above the floor of controlled airspace.\n\nNOTE-\nOROCA is a published altitude which provides 1,000 feet of terrain and obstruction clearance in the U.S. (2,000 feet of clearance in designated mountainous areas). These altitudes are not assessed for NAVAID signal coverage, air traffic control surveillance, or communications coverage, and are published for general situational awareness, flight planning and in-flight contingency use.\n\n\nBecause of differences in the areas considered for MVA, and those applied to other minimum altitudes, and the ability to isolate specific obstacles, some MVAs may be lower than the nonradar Minimum En Route Altitudes (MEAs), Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitudes (MOCAs) or other minimum altitudes depicted on charts for a given location. While being radar vectored, IFR altitude assignments by ATC will be at or above MVA.\n\nThe MVA/MIA may be lower than the TAA minimum altitude.\u00a0If ATC has assigned an altitude to an aircraft that is below the TAA minimum altitude, the aircraft will either be assigned an altitude to maintain until established on a segment of a published route or instrument approach procedure, or climbed to the TAA altitude.\n\nCircling. Circling minimums charted on an RNAV (GPS) approach chart may be lower than the LNAV/VNAV line of minima, but never lower than the LNAV line of minima (straight-in approach). Pilots may safely perform the circling maneuver at the circling published line of minima if the approach and circling maneuver is properly performed according to aircraft category and operational limitations.\nFIG 5-4-12Example of LNAV and Circling Minima Lower Than LNAV/VNAV DA.\nHarrisburg International RNAV (GPS) RWY 13FIG 5-4-13Explanation of LNAV and/or Circling Minima Lower than LNAV/VNAV DA\n\nFIG 5-4-13 provides a visual representation of an obstacle evaluation and calculation of LNAV MDA, Circling MDA, LNAV/VNAV DA.\n\nNo vertical guidance (LNAV). A line is drawn horizontal at obstacle height and 250 feet added for Required Obstacle Clearance (ROC). The controlling obstacle used to determine LNAV MDA can be different than the controlling obstacle used in determining ROC for circling MDA. Other factors may force a number larger than 250 ft to be added to the LNAV OCS. The number is rounded up to the next higher 20 foot increment.\n\n\nCircling MDA. The circling MDA will provide 300 foot obstacle clearance within the area considered for obstacle clearance and may be lower than the LNAV/VNAV DA, but never lower than the straight in LNAV MDA. This may occur when different controlling obstacles are used or when other controlling factors force the LNAV MDA to be higher than 250 feet above the LNAV OCS. In FIG 5-4-12, the required obstacle clearance for both the LNAV and Circle resulted in the same MDA, but lower than the LNAV/VNAV DA. FIG 5-4-13 provides an illustration of this type of situation.\n\nVertical guidance (LNAV/VNAV). A line is drawn horizontal at obstacle height until reaching the obstacle clearance surface (OCS). At the OCS, a vertical line is drawn until reaching the glide path. This is the DA for the approach. This method places the offending obstacle in front of the LNAV/VNAV DA so it can be seen and avoided. In some situations, this may result in the LNAV/VNAV DA being higher than the LNAV and/or Circling MDA.\n\nThe Visual Descent Point (VDP), identified by the symbol (V), is a defined point on the final approach course of a nonprecision straight-in approach procedure from which a stabilized visual descent from the MDA to the runway touchdown point may be commenced. The pilot should not descend below the MDA prior to reaching the VDP. The VDP will be identified by DME or RNAV along-track distance to the MAP. The VDP distance is based on the lowest MDA published on the IAP and harmonized with the angle of the visual glide slope indicator (VGSI) (if installed) or the procedure VDA (if no VGSI is installed). A VDP may not be published under certain circumstances which may result in a destabilized descent between the MDA and the runway touchdown point. Such circumstances include an obstacle penetrating the visual surface between the MDA and runway threshold, lack of distance measuring capability, or the procedure design prevents a VDP to be identified.\n\nVGSI systems may be used as a visual aid to the pilot to determine if the aircraft is in a position to make a stabilized descent from the MDA. When the visibility is close to minimums, the VGSI may not be visible at the VDP due to its location beyond the MAP.\n\n\nPilots not equipped to receive the VDP should fly the approach procedure as though no VDP had been provided.\n\nOn a straight-in nonprecision IAP, descent below the MDA between the VDP and the MAP may be inadvisable or impossible. Aircraft speed, height above the runway, descent rate, amount of turn, and runway length are some of the factors which must be considered by the pilot to determine if a safe descent and landing can be accomplished.\n\nA visual segment obstruction evaluation is accomplished during procedure design on all IAPs. Obstacles (both lighted and unlighted) are allowed to penetrate the visual segment obstacle identification surfaces. Identified obstacle penetrations may cause restrictions to instrument approach operations which may include an increased approach visibility requirement, not publishing a VDP, and/or prohibiting night instrument operations to the runway. There is no implicit obstacle protection from the MDA/DA to the touchdown point. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of the pilot to visually acquire and avoid obstacles below the MDA/DA during transition to landing.\n\nUnlighted obstacle penetrations may result in prohibiting night instrument operations to the runway. A chart note will be published in the pilot briefing strip \u201cProcedure NA at Night.\u201d\n\n\nUse of a VGSI may be approved in lieu of obstruction lighting to restore night instrument operations to the runway. A chart note will be published in the pilot briefing strip \u201c Straight-in Rwy XX at Night, operational VGSI required, remain on or above VGSI glidepath until threshold.\u201d\n\nThe highest obstacle (man-made, terrain, or vegetation) will be charted on the planview of an IAP. Other obstacles may be charted in either the planview or the airport sketch based on distance from the runway and available chart space. The elevation of the charted obstacle will be shown to the nearest foot above mean sea level. Obstacles without a verified accuracy are indicated by a \u00b1 symbol following the elevation value.\n\nVertical Descent Angle (VDA). FAA policy is to publish a VDA/TCH on all nonprecision approaches except those published in conjunction with vertically guided minimums (i.e., ILS or LOC RWY XX) or no-FAF procedures without a step-down fix (i.e., on-airport VOR or NDB). A VDA does not guarantee obstacle protection below the MDA in the visual segment. The presence of a VDA does not change any nonprecision approach requirements.\n\nObstacles may penetrate the obstacle identification surface below the MDA in the visual segment of an IAP that has a published VDA/TCH. When the VDA/TCH is not authorized due to an obstacle penetration that would require a pilot to deviate from the VDA between MDA and touchdown, the VDA/TCH will be replaced with the note \u201cVisual Segment- Obstacles\u201d in the profile view of the IAP (See FIG 5-4-14). Accordingly, pilots are advised to carefully review approach procedures to identify where the optimum stabilized descent to landing can be initiated. Pilots that follow the previously published descent angle, provided by the RNAV system, below the MDA on procedures with this note may encounter obstacles in the visual segment. Pilots must visually avoid any obstacles below the MDA.\n\nVDA/TCH data is furnished by FAA on the official source document for publication on IAP charts and for coding in the navigation database unless, as noted previously, replaced by the note \u201cVisual Segment - Obstacles.\u201d\n\n\nCommercial chart providers and navigation systems may publish or calculate a VDA/TCH even when the FAA does not provide such data. Pilots are cautioned that they are responsible for obstacle avoidance in the visual segment regardless of the presence or absence of a VDA/TCH and associated navigation system advisory vertical guidance.\n\n\nThe threshold crossing height (TCH) used to compute the descent angle is published with the VDA. The VDA and TCH information are charted on the profile view of the IAP following the fix (FAF/stepdown) used to compute the VDA. If no PA/APV IAP is established to the same runway, the VDA will be equal to or higher than the glide path angle of the VGSI installed on the same runway provided it is within instrument procedure criteria. A chart note will indicate if the VGSI is not coincident with the VDA. Pilots must be aware that the published VDA is for advisory information only and not to be considered instrument procedure derived vertical guidance. The VDA solely offers an aid to help pilots establish a continuous, stabilized descent during final approach.\n\nPilots may use the published angle and estimated/actual groundspeed to find a target rate of descent from the rate of descent table published in the back of the U.S. Terminal Procedures Publication. This rate of descent can be flown with the Vertical Velocity Indicator (VVI) in order to use the VDA as an aid to flying a stabilized descent. No special equipment is required.\nFIG 5-4-14Example of a Chart Note\n\nA straight-in aligned procedure may be restricted to circling only minimums when an excessive descent gradient necessitates. The descent angle between the FAF/stepdown fix and the Circling MDA must not exceed the maximum descent angle allowed by TERPS criteria. A published VDA on these procedures does not imply that landing straight ahead is recommended or even possible. The descent rate based on the VDA may exceed the capabilities of the aircraft and the pilot must determine how to best maneuver the aircraft within the circling area in order to land safely.\n\nIn isolated cases, an IAP may contain a published visual flight path. These procedures are annotated \u201cFly Visual to Airport\u201d or \u201cFly Visual.\u201d A dashed arrow indicating the visual flight path will be included in the profile and plan views with an approximate heading and distance to the end of the runway.\n\nThe depicted ground track associated with the \u201cFly Visual to Airport\u201d segment should be flown as a \u201cDead Reckoning\u201d course. When executing the \u201cFly Visual to Airport\u201d segment, the flight visibility must not be less than that prescribed in the IAP; the pilot must remain clear of clouds and proceed to the airport maintaining visual contact with the ground. Altitude on the visual flight path is at the discretion of the pilot, and it is the responsibility of the pilot to visually acquire and avoid obstacles in the \u201cFly Visual to Airport\u201d segment.\n\n\nMissed approach obstacle clearance is assured only if the missed approach is commenced at the published MAP. Before initiating an IAP that contains a \u201cFly Visual to Airport\u201d segment, the pilot should have preplanned climb out options based on aircraft performance and terrain features. Obstacle clearance is the responsibility of the pilot when the approach is continued beyond the MAP.\n\nNOTE-\nThe FAA Administrator retains the authority to approve instrument approach procedures where the pilot may not necessarily have one of the visual references specified in 14\u2009CFR \u00a7 91.175 and related rules. It is not a function of procedure design to ensure compliance with \u00a7\u200991.175. The annotation \u201cFly Visual to Airport\u201d provides relief from \u00a7\u200991.175 requirements that the pilot have distinctly visible and identifiable visual references prior to descent below MDA/DA.\n\nArea Navigation (RNAV) Instrument Approach Charts.  Reliance on RNAV systems for instrument operations is becoming more commonplace as new systems such as GPS and augmented GPS such as the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) are developed and deployed. In order to support full integration of RNAV procedures into the National Airspace System (NAS), the FAA developed a new charting format for IAPs (See FIG 5-4-6). This format avoids unnecessary duplication and proliferation of instrument approach charts. The original stand alone GPS charts, titled simply \u201cGPS,\u201d are being converted to the newer format as the procedures are revised. One reason for the revision is the addition of WAAS based minima to the approach chart. The reformatted approach chart is titled \u201cRNAV (GPS) RWY XX.\u201d Up to four lines of minima are included on these charts. Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) Landing System (GLS) was a placeholder for future WAAS and LAAS minima, and the minima was always listed as N/A. The GLS minima line has now been replaced by the WAAS LPV (Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance) minima on most RNAV (GPS) charts. LNAV/VNAV (lateral navigation/vertical navigation) was added to support both WAAS electronic vertical guidance and Barometric VNAV. LPV and LNAV/VNAV are both APV procedures as described in paragraph 5-4-5a7. The original GPS minima, titled \u201cS-XX,\u201d for straight in runway XX, is retitled LNAV (lateral navigation). Circling minima may also be published. A new type of nonprecision WAAS minima will also be published on this chart and titled LP (localizer performance). LP will be published in locations where vertically guided minima cannot be provided due to terrain and obstacles and therefore, no LPV or LNAV/VNAV minima will be published. GBAS procedures are published on a separate chart and the GLS minima line is to be used only for GBAS. ATC clearance for the RNAV procedure authorizes a properly certified pilot to utilize any minimums for which the aircraft is certified (for example, a WAAS equipped aircraft utilizes the LPV or LP minima but a GPS only aircraft may not). The RNAV chart includes information formatted for quick reference by the pilot or flight crew at the top of the chart. This portion of the chart, developed based on a study by the Department of Transportation, Volpe National Transportation System Center, is commonly referred to as the pilot briefing.\n\nThe minima lines are:\n\nGLS. \u201cGLS\u201d is the acronym for GBAS Landing System. The U.S. version of GBAS has traditionally been referred to as LAAS. The worldwide community has adopted GBAS as the official term for this type of navigation system. To coincide with international terminology, the FAA is also adopting the term GBAS to be consistent with the international community. This line was originally published as a placeholder for both WAAS and LAAS minima and marked as N/A since no minima was published. As the concepts for GBAS and WAAS procedure publication have evolved, GLS will now be used only for GBAS minima, which will be on a separate approach chart. Most RNAV(GPS) approach charts have had the GLS minima line replaced by a WAAS LPV line of minima.\n\n\nLPV. \u201cLPV\u201d is the acronym for localizer performance with vertical guidance. RNAV (GPS) approaches to LPV lines of minima take advantage of the improved accuracy of WAAS lateral and vertical guidance to provide an approach that is very similar to a Category I Instrument Landing System (ILS). The approach to LPV line of minima is designed for angular guidance with increasing sensitivity as the aircraft gets closer to the runway. The sensitivities are nearly identical to those of the ILS at similar distances. This was done intentionally to allow the skills required to proficiently fly an ILS to readily transfer to flying RNAV (GPS) approaches to the LPV line of minima. Just as with an ILS, the LPV has vertical guidance and is flown to a DA. Aircraft can fly this minima line with a statement in the Aircraft Flight Manual that the installed equipment supports LPV approaches. This includes Class 3 and 4 TSO-C146 GPS/WAAS equipment.\n\nLNAV/VNAV. LNAV/VNAV identifies APV minimums developed to accommodate an RNAV IAP with vertical guidance, usually provided by approach certified Baro-VNAV, but with lateral and vertical integrity limits larger than a precision approach or LPV. LNAV stands for Lateral Navigation; VNAV stands for Vertical Navigation. This minima line can be flown by aircraft with a statement in the Aircraft Flight Manual that the installed equipment supports GPS approaches and has an approach-approved barometric VNAV, or if the aircraft has been demonstrated to support LNAV/VNAV approaches. This includes Class 2, 3 and 4 TSO-C146 GPS/WAAS equipment. Aircraft using LNAV/VNAV minimums will descend to landing via an internally generated descent path based on satellite or other approach approved VNAV systems. Since electronic vertical guidance is provided, the minima will be published as a DA. Other navigation systems may be specifically authorized to use this line of minima. (See Section A, Terms/Landing Minima Data, of the U.S. Terminal Procedures books.)\n\nLP. \u201cLP\u201d is the acronym for localizer performance. Approaches to LP lines of minima take advantage of the improved accuracy of WAAS to provide approaches, with lateral guidance and angular guidance. Angular guidance does not refer to a glideslope angle but rather to the increased lateral sensitivity as the aircraft gets closer to the runway, similar to localizer approaches. However, the LP line of minima is a Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) rather than a DA (H). Procedures with LP lines of minima will not be published with another approach that contains approved vertical guidance (LNAV/VNAV or LPV). It is possible to have LP and LNAV published on the same approach chart but LP will only be published if it provides lower minima than an LNAV line of minima. LP is not a fail-down mode for LPV. LP will only be published if terrain, obstructions, or some other reason prevent publishing a vertically guided procedure. WAAS avionics may provide GNSS-based advisory vertical guidance during an approach to an LP line of minima. Barometric altimeter information remains the primary altitude reference for complying with any altitude restrictions. WAAS equipment may not support LP, even if it supports LPV, if it was approved before TSO-C145b and TSO-C146b. Receivers approved under previous TSOs may require an upgrade by the manufacturer in order to be used to fly to LP minima. Receivers approved for LP must have a statement in the approved Flight Manual or Supplemental Flight Manual including LP as one of the approved approach types.\n\nLNAV. This minima is for lateral navigation only, and the approach minimum altitude will be published as a minimum descent altitude (MDA). LNAV provides the same level of service as the present GPS stand alone approaches. LNAV minimums support the following navigation systems: WAAS, when the navigation solution will not support vertical navigation; and, GPS navigation systems which are presently authorized to conduct GPS approaches.\n\nNOTE-\nGPS receivers approved for approach operations in accordance with: AC 20-138, Airworthiness Approval of  Positioning and Navigation Systems, qualify for this minima. WAAS navigation equipment must be approved in accordance with the requirements specified in TSO-C145() or TSO-C146() and installed in accordance with Advisory Circular AC 20-138.\n\n\nOther systems may be authorized to utilize these approaches. See the description in Section A of the U.S. Terminal Procedures books for details. Operational approval must also be obtained for Baro-VNAV systems to operate to the LNAV/VNAV minimums. Baro-VNAV may not be authorized on some approaches due to other factors, such as no local altimeter source being available. Baro-VNAV is not authorized on LPV procedures. Pilots are directed to their local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) for additional information.\n\nNOTE-\nRNAV and Baro-VNAV systems must have a manufacturer supplied electronic database which must include the waypoints, altitudes, and vertical data for the procedure to be flown. The system must be able to retrieve the procedure by name from the aircraft navigation database, not just as a manually entered series of waypoints.\n\nILS or RNAV (GPS) charts.\n\nSome RNAV (GPS) charts will also contain an ILS line of minima to make use of the ILS precision final in conjunction with the RNAV GPS capabilities for the portions of the procedure prior to the final approach segment and for the missed approach. Obstacle clearance for the portions of the procedure other than the final approach segment is still based on GPS criteria.\n\nNOTE-\nSome GPS receiver installations inhibit GPS navigation whenever ANY ILS frequency is tuned. Pilots flying aircraft with receivers installed in this manner must wait until they are on the intermediate segment of the procedure prior to the PFAF (PFAF is the active waypoint) to tune the ILS frequency and must tune the ILS back to a VOR frequency in order to fly the GPS based missed approach.\n\n\nCharting. There are charting differences between ILS, RNAV (GPS), and GLS approaches.\n\nThe LAAS procedure is titled \u201cGLS RWY XX\u201d on the approach chart.\n\n\nThe VDB provides information to the airborne receiver where the guidance is synthesized.\n\nThe LAAS procedure is identified by a four alpha-numeric character field referred to as the RPI or approach ID and is similar to the IDENT feature of the ILS.\n\nThe RPI is charted.\n\nMost RNAV(GPS) approach charts have had the GLS (NA) minima line replaced by an LPV line of minima.\n\nSince the concepts for LAAS and WAAS procedure publication have evolved, GLS will now be used only for LAAS minima, which will be on a separate approach chart.\n\nRequired Navigation Performance (RNP).\n\nPilots are advised to refer to the \u201cTERMS/LANDING MINIMUMS DATA\u201d (Section\u2009A) of the U.S. Government Terminal Procedures books for aircraft approach eligibility requirements by specific RNP level requirements.\n\n\nSome aircraft have RNP approval in their AFM without a GPS sensor. The lowest level of sensors that the FAA will support for RNP service is DME/DME. However, necessary DME signal may not be available at the airport of intended operations. For those locations having an RNAV chart published with LNAV/VNAV minimums, a procedure note may be provided such as \u201cDME/DME RNP-0.3 NA.\u201d This means that RNP aircraft dependent on DME/DME to achieve RNP-0.3 are not authorized to conduct this approach. Where DME facility availability is a factor, the note may read \u201cDME/DME RNP-0.3 Authorized; ABC and XYZ Required.\u201d This means that ABC and XYZ facilities have been determined by flight inspection to be required in the navigation solution to assure RNP-0.3. VOR/DME updating must not be used for approach procedures.\n\nChart Terminology.\n\nDecision Altitude (DA) replaces the familiar term Decision Height (DH). DA conforms to the international convention where altitudes relate to MSL and heights relate to AGL. DA will eventually be published for other types of instrument approach procedures with vertical guidance, as well. DA indicates to the pilot that the published descent profile is flown to the DA (MSL), where a missed approach will be initiated if visual references for landing are not established. Obstacle clearance is provided to allow a momentary descent below DA while transitioning from the final approach to the missed approach. The aircraft is expected to follow the missed instructions while continuing along the published final approach course to at least the published runway threshold waypoint or MAP (if not at the threshold) before executing any turns.\n\n\nMinimum Descent Altitude (MDA) has been in use for many years, and will continue to be used for the LNAV only and circling procedures.\n\nThreshold Crossing Height (TCH) has been traditionally used in \u201cprecision\u201d approaches as the height of the glide slope above threshold. With publication of LNAV/VNAV minimums and RNAV descent angles, including graphically depicted descent profiles, TCH also applies to the height of the \u201cdescent angle,\u201d or glidepath, at the threshold. Unless otherwise required for larger type aircraft which may be using the IAP, the typical TCH is 30 to 50 feet.\n\nThe MINIMA FORMAT will also change slightly.\n\nEach line of minima on the RNAV IAP is titled to reflect the level of service available; e.g., GLS, LPV, LNAV/VNAV, LP, and LNAV. CIRCLING minima will also be provided.\n\n\nThe minima title box indicates the nature of the minimum altitude for the IAP. For example:\n\nDA will be published next to the minima line title for minimums supporting vertical guidance such as for GLS, LPV or LNAV/VNAV.\n\n\nMDA will be published as the minima line on approaches with lateral guidance only, LNAV, or LP. Descent below the MDA must meet the conditions stated in 14 CFR Section 91.175.\n\nWhere two or more systems, such as LPV and LNAV/VNAV, share the same minima, each line of minima will be displayed separately.\n\nChart Symbology changed slightly to include:\n\nDescent Profile. The published descent profile and a graphical depiction of the vertical path to the runway will be shown. Graphical depiction of the RNAV vertical guidance will differ from the traditional depiction of an ILS glide slope (feather) through the use of a shorter vertical track beginning at the decision altitude.\n\nIt is FAA policy to design IAPs with minimum altitudes established at fixes/waypoints to achieve optimum stabilized (constant rate) descents within each procedure segment. This design can enhance the safety of the operations and contribute toward reduction in the occurrence of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents. Additionally, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recently emphasized that pilots could benefit from publication of the appropriate IAP descent angle for a stabilized descent on final approach. The RNAV IAP format includes the descent angle to the hundredth of a degree; e.g., 3.00 degrees. The angle will be provided in the graphically depicted descent profile.\n\n\nThe stabilized approach may be performed by reference to vertical navigation information provided by WAAS or LNAV/VNAV systems; or for LNAV-only systems, by the pilot determining the appropriate aircraft attitude/groundspeed combination to attain a constant rate descent which best emulates the published angle. To aid the pilot, U.S. Government Terminal Procedures Publication charts publish an expanded Rate of Descent Table on the inside of the back hard cover for use in planning and executing precision descents under known or approximate groundspeed conditions.\n\n\nVisual Descent Point (VDP). A VDP will be published on most RNAV IAPs. VDPs apply only to aircraft utilizing LP or LNAV minima, not LPV or LNAV/VNAV minimums.\n\nMissed Approach Symbology. In order to make missed approach guidance more readily understood, a method has been developed to display missed approach guidance in the profile view through the use of quick reference icons. Due to limited space in the profile area, only four or fewer icons can be shown. However, the icons may not provide representation of the entire missed approach procedure. The entire set of textual missed approach instructions are provided at the top of the approach chart in the pilot briefing. (See FIG 5-4-6).\n\nWaypoints. All RNAV or GPS stand-alone IAPs are flown using data pertaining to the particular IAP obtained from an onboard database, including the sequence of all WPs used for the approach and missed approach, except that step down waypoints may not be included in some TSO-C129 receiver databases. Included in the database, in most receivers, is coding that informs the navigation system of which WPs are fly-over (FO) or fly-by (FB). The navigation system may provide guidance appropriately - including leading the turn prior to a fly-by WP; or causing overflight of a fly-over WP. Where the navigation system does not provide such guidance, the pilot must accomplish the turn lead or waypoint overflight manually. Chart symbology for the FB WP provides pilot awareness of expected actions. Refer to the legend of the U.S. Terminal Procedures books.\n\nTAAs are described in paragraph 5-4-5d, Terminal Arrival Area (TAA). When published, the RNAV chart depicts the TAA areas through the use of \u201cicons\u201d representing each TAA area associated with the RNAV procedure (See FIG 5-4-6). These icons are depicted in the plan view of the approach chart, generally arranged on the chart in accordance with their position relative to the aircraft's arrival from the en route structure. The WP, to which navigation is appropriate and expected within each specific TAA area, will be named and depicted on the associated TAA icon. Each depicted named WP is the IAF for arrivals from within that area. TAAs may not be used on all RNAV procedures because of airspace congestion or other reasons.\n\nPublished Temperature Limitations. There are currently two temperature limitations that may be published in the notes box of the middle briefing strip on an instrument approach procedure (IAP). The two published temperature limitations are:\n\nA temperature range limitation associated with the use of baro-VNAV that may be published on a United States PBN IAP titled RNAV (GPS) or RNAV (RNP); and/or\n\n\nA Cold Temperature Airport (CTA) limitation designated by a snowflake ICON and temperature in Celsius (C) that is published on every IAP for the airfield.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Chapter 7, Section 3, Cold Temperature Barometric Altimeter Errors, Setting Procedures and Cold Temperature Airports (CTA).\n\n\nWAAS Channel Number/Approach ID. The WAAS Channel Number is an optional equipment capability that allows the use of a 5-digit number to select a specific final approach segment without using the menu method. The Approach ID is an airport unique 4-character combination for verifying the selection and extraction of the correct final approach segment information from the aircraft database. It is similar to the ILS ident, but displayed visually rather than aurally. The Approach ID consists of the letter W for WAAS, the runway number, and a letter other than L, C or R, which could be confused with Left, Center and Right, e.g., W35A. Approach IDs are assigned in the order that WAAS approaches are built to that runway number at that airport. The WAAS Channel Number and Approach ID are displayed in the upper left corner of the approach procedure pilot briefing.\n\nAt locations where outages of WAAS vertical guidance may occur daily due to initial system limitations, a negative W symbol () will be placed on RNAV (GPS) approach charts. Many of these outages will be very short in duration, but may result in the disruption of the vertical portion of the approach. The  symbol indicates that NOTAMs or Air Traffic advisories are not provided for outages which occur in the WAAS LNAV/VNAV or LPV vertical service. Use LNAV or circling minima for flight planning at these locations, whether as a destination or alternate. For flight operations at these locations, when the WAAS avionics indicate that LNAV/VNAV or LPV service is available, then vertical guidance may be used to complete the approach using the displayed level of service. Should an outage occur during the procedure, reversion to LNAV minima may be required. As the WAAS coverage is expanded, the  will be removed.\n\nNOTE-\nProperly trained and approved, as required, TSO-C145() and TSO-C146() equipped users (WAAS users) with and using approved baro-VNAV equipment  may plan for LNAV/VNAV DA at an alternate airport. Specifically authorized WAAS users with and using approved baro-VNAV equipment may also plan for RNP 0.3 DA at the alternate airport as long as the pilot has verified RNP availability through an approved prediction program."

Even though clearance for the approach may have been issued prior to the aircraft reaching the holding fix, ATC would expect the pilot to proceed via the holding fix (his/her last assigned route), and the feeder route associated with that fix (if a feeder route is published on the approach chart) to the initial approach fix (IAF) to commence the approach. WHEN CLEARED FOR THE APPROACH, THE PUBLISHED OFF AIRWAY (FEEDER) ROUTES THAT LEAD FROM THE EN\u2009ROUTE STRUCTURE TO THE IAF ARE PART OF THE APPROACH CLEARANCE.\n\n\nIf a feeder route to an IAF begins at a fix located along the route of flight prior to reaching the holding fix, and clearance for an approach is issued, a pilot should commence the approach via the published feeder route; i.e., the aircraft would not be expected to overfly the feeder route and return to it. The pilot is expected to commence the approach in a similar manner at the IAF, if the IAF for the procedure is located along the route of flight to the holding fix.\n\nIf a route of flight directly to the initial approach fix is desired, it should be so stated by the controller with phraseology to include the words \u201cdirect . . .,\u201d \u201cproceed direct\u201d or a similar phrase which the pilot can interpret without question. When uncertain of the clearance, immediately query ATC as to what route of flight is desired.\n\nThe name of an instrument approach, as published, is used to identify the approach, even though a component of the approach aid, such as the glideslope on an Instrument Landing System, is inoperative or unreliable. The controller will use the name of the approach as published, but must advise the aircraft at the time an approach clearance is issued that the inoperative or unreliable approach aid component is unusable, except when the title of the published approach procedures otherwise allows; for example, ILS Rwy 05 or LOC Rwy 05.\n\nThe following applies to aircraft on radar vectors and/or cleared \u201cdirect to\u201d in conjunction with an approach clearance:\n\nMaintain the last altitude assigned by ATC until the aircraft is established on a published segment of a transition route, or approach procedure segment, or other published route, for which a lower altitude is published on the chart. If already on an established route, or approach or arrival segment, you may descend to whatever minimum altitude is listed for that route or segment.\n\n\nContinue on the vector heading until intercepting the next published ground track applicable to the approach clearance.\n\nOnce reaching the final approach fix via the published segments, the pilot may continue on approach to a landing.\n\nIf proceeding to an IAF with a published course reversal (procedure turn or hold-in-lieu of PT pattern), except when cleared for a straight in approach by ATC, the pilot must execute the procedure turn/hold-in-lieu of PT, and complete the approach.\n\nIf cleared to an IAF/IF via a NoPT route, or no procedure turn/hold-in-lieu of PT is published, continue with the published approach.\n\nIn addition to the above, RNAV aircraft may be issued a clearance direct to the IAF/IF at intercept angles not greater than 90 degrees for both conventional and RNAV instrument approaches. Controllers may issue a heading or a course direct to a fix between the IF and FAF at intercept angles not greater than 30\u2009degrees for both conventional and RNAV instrument approaches. In all cases, controllers will assign altitudes that ensure obstacle clearance and will permit a normal descent to the FAF. When clearing aircraft direct to the IF, ATC will radar monitor the aircraft until the IF and will advise the pilot to expect clearance direct to the IF at least 5 miles from the fix. ATC must issue a straight-in approach clearance when clearing an aircraft direct to an IAF/IF with a procedure turn or hold-in-lieu of a procedure turn, and ATC does not want the aircraft to execute the course reversal.\n\nNOTE-\nRefer to 14 CFR 91.175 (i).\n\nRNAV aircraft may be issued a clearance direct to the FAF that is also charted as an IAF, in which case the pilot is expected to execute the depicted procedure turn or hold-in-lieu of procedure turn. \u00a0ATC will not issue a straight-in approach clearance.\u00a0 If the pilot desires a straight-in approach, they must request vectors to the final approach course outside of the FAF or fly a published \u201cNoPT\u201d route.\u00a0 When visual approaches are in use, ATC may clear an aircraft direct to the FAF.\n\nNOTE-\nIn anticipation of a clearance by ATC to any fix published on an instrument approach procedure, pilots of RNAV aircraft are advised to select an appropriate IAF or feeder fix when loading an instrument approach procedure into the RNAV system.Selection of \u201cVectors-to-Final\u201d or \u201cVectors\u201d option for an instrument approach may prevent approach fixes located outside of the FAF from being loaded into an RNAV system. Therefore, the selection of these options is discouraged due to increased workload for pilots to reprogram the navigation system.\n\nArrival Holding. Some approach charts have an arrival holding pattern depicted at an IAF or at a feeder fix located along an airway. The arrival hold is depicted using a \u201cthin line\u201d since it is not always a mandatory part of the instrument procedure.\n\nArrival holding is charted where holding is frequently required prior to starting the approach procedure so that detailed holding instructions are not required. The arrival holding pattern is not authorized unless assigned by ATC. Holding at the same fix may also be depicted on the en route chart.\n\n\nArrival holding is also charted where it is necessary to use a holding pattern to align the aircraft for procedure entry from an airway due to turn angle limitations imposed by procedure design standards. When the turn angle from an airway into the approach procedure exceeds the permissible limits, an arrival holding pattern may be published along with a note on the procedure specifying the fix, the airway, and arrival direction where use of the arrival hold is required for procedure entry. Unlike a hold-in-lieu of procedure turn, use of the arrival holding pattern is not authorized until assigned by ATC. If ATC does not assign the arrival hold before reaching the holding fix, the pilot should request the hold for procedure entry. Once established on the inbound holding course and an approach clearance has been received, the published procedure can commence. Alternatively, if using the holding pattern for procedure entry is not desired, the pilot may ask ATC for maneuvering airspace to align the aircraft with the feeder course.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nPlanview Chart Note: \u201cProc NA via V343 northeast bound without holding at JOXIT. ATC CLNC REQD.\u201d\nAn RF leg is defined as a constant radius circular path around a defined turn center that starts and terminates at a fix. An RF leg may be published as part of a procedure. Since not all aircraft have the capability to fly these leg types, pilots are responsible for knowing if they can conduct an RNAV approach with an RF leg. Requirements for RF legs will be indicated on the approach chart in the notes section or at the applicable initial approach fix. Controllers will clear RNAV-equipped aircraft for instrument approach procedures containing RF legs:\n\nVia published transitions, or\n\n\nIn accordance with paragraph e6 above, and\n\nATC will not clear aircraft direct to any waypoint beginning or within an RF leg, and will not assign fix/waypoint crossing speeds in excess of charted speed restrictions.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nControllers will not clear aircraft direct to THIRD because that waypoint begins the RF leg, and aircraft cannot be vectored or cleared to TURNN or vectored to intercept the approach segment at any point between THIRD and FORTH because this is the RF leg. (See FIG 5-4-15.)\nWhen necessary to cancel a previously issued approach clearance, the controller will advise the pilot \u201cCancel Approach Clearance\u201d followed by any additional instructions when applicable."

                "section-content": "Aircraft approach category means a grouping of aircraft based on a speed of VREF at the maximum certified landing weight, if specified, or if VREF is not specified, 1.3VSO at the maximum certified landing weight. VREF, VSO, and the maximum certified landing weight are those values as established for the aircraft by the certification authority of the country of registry. A pilot must maneuver the aircraft within the circling approach protected area (see FIG 5-4-27) to achieve the obstacle and terrain clearances provided by procedure design criteria.\n\n\nIn addition to pilot techniques for maneuvering, one acceptable method to reduce the risk of flying out of the circling approach protected area is to use either the minima corresponding to the category determined during certification or minima associated with a higher category. Helicopters may use Category A minima. If it is necessary to operate at a speed in excess of the upper limit of the speed range for an aircraft's category, the minimums for the higher category should be used. This may occur with certain aircraft types operating in heavy/gusty wind, icing, or non-normal conditions. For example, an airplane which fits into Category B, but is circling to land at a speed of 145 knots, should use the approach Category D minimums. As an additional example, a Category A airplane (or helicopter) which is operating at 130 knots on a straight-in approach should use the approach Category C minimums.\n\nA pilot who chooses an alternative method when it is necessary to maneuver at a speed that exceeds the category speed limit (for example, where higher category minimums are not published) should consider the following factors that can significantly affect the actual ground track flown:\n\nBank angle. For example, at 165 knots groundspeed, the radius of turn increases from 4,194\u2009feet using 30 degrees of bank to 6,654 feet when using 20 degrees of bank. When using a shallower bank angle, it may be necessary to modify the flightpath or indicated airspeed to remain within the circling approach protected area. Pilots should be aware that excessive bank angle can lead to a loss of aircraft control.\n\n\nIndicated airspeed. Procedure design criteria typically utilize the highest speed for a particular category. If a pilot chooses to operate at a higher speed, other factors should be modified to ensure that the aircraft remains within the circling approach protected area.\n\nWind speed and direction. For example, it is not uncommon to maneuver the aircraft to a downwind leg where the groundspeed will be considerably higher than the indicated airspeed. Pilots must carefully plan the initiation of all turns to ensure that the aircraft remains within the circling approach protected area.\n\nPilot technique. Pilots frequently have many options with regard to flightpath when conducting circling approaches. Sound planning and judgment are vital to proper execution. The lateral and vertical path to be flown should be carefully considered using current weather and terrain information to ensure that the aircraft remains within the circling approach protected area.\n\nIt is important to remember that 14 CFR Section\u200991.175(c) requires that \u201cwhere a DA/DH or MDA is applicable, no pilot may operate an aircraft below the authorized MDA or continue an approach below the authorized DA/DH unless the aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers, and for operations conducted under Part 121 or Part 135 unless that descent rate will allow touchdown to occur within the touchdown zone of the runway of intended landing.\u201d\n\nSee the following category limits:\n\nCategory A: Speed less than 91 knots.\n\n\nCategory B: Speed 91 knots or more but less than 121 knots.\n\nCategory C: Speed 121 knots or more but less than 141 knots.\n\nCategory D: Speed 141 knots or more but less than 166 knots.\n\nCategory E: Speed 166 knots or more.\n\nNOTE-\nVREF in the above definition refers to the speed used in establishing the approved landing distance under the airworthiness regulations constituting the type certification basis of the airplane, regardless of whether that speed for a particular airplane is 1.3\u2009VSO, 1.23\u2009VSR, or some higher speed required for airplane controllability. This speed, at the maximum certificated landing weight, determines the lowest applicable approach category for all\u2009approaches regardless of actual landing weight.\n\nWhen operating on an unpublished route or while being radar vectored, the pilot, when an approach clearance is received, must, in addition to complying with the minimum altitudes for IFR operations (14 CFR Section\u200991.177), maintain the last assigned altitude unless a different altitude is assigned by ATC, or until the aircraft is established on a segment of a published route or IAP. After the aircraft is so established, published altitudes apply to descent within each succeeding route or approach segment unless a different altitude is assigned by ATC. Notwithstanding this pilot responsibility, for aircraft operating on unpublished routes or while being radar vectored, ATC will, except when conducting a radar approach, issue an IFR approach clearance only after the aircraft is established on a segment of a published route or IAP, or assign an altitude to maintain until the aircraft is established on a segment of a published route or instrument approach procedure. For this purpose, the procedure turn of a published IAP must not be considered a segment of that IAP until the aircraft reaches the initial fix or navigation facility upon which the procedure turn is predicated.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nCross Redding VOR at or above five thousand, cleared VOR runway three four approach. \nor\nFive miles from outer marker, turn right heading three three zero, maintain two thousand until established on the localizer, cleared ILS runway three six approach.\nNOTE-\nThe altitude assigned will assure IFR obstruction clearance from the point at which the approach clearance is issued until established on a segment of a published route or IAP. If uncertain of the meaning of the clearance, immediately request clarification from ATC.An aircraft is not established on an approach while below published approach altitudes. If the MVA/MIA allows, and ATC assigns an altitude below an IF or IAF altitude, the pilot will be issued an altitude to maintain until past a point that the aircraft is established on the approach.\n\nSeveral IAPs, using various navigation and approach aids may be authorized for an airport. ATC may advise that a particular approach procedure is being used, primarily to expedite traffic. If issued a clearance that specifies a particular approach procedure, notify ATC immediately if a different one is desired. In this event it may be necessary for ATC to withhold clearance for the different approach until such time as traffic conditions permit. However, a pilot involved in an emergency situation will be given priority. If the pilot is not familiar with the specific approach procedure, ATC should be advised and they will provide detailed information on the execution of the procedure.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-4-4, Advance Information on Instrument Approach.\n\n\nThe name of an instrument approach, as published, is used to identify the approach, even though a component of the approach aid, such as the glideslope on an Instrument Landing System, is inoperative or unreliable. The controller will use the name of the approach as published, but must advise the aircraft at the time an approach clearance is issued that the inoperative or unreliable approach aid component is unusable, except when the title of the published approach procedures otherwise allows, for example, ILS or LOC.\n\nExcept when being radar vectored to the final approach course, when cleared for a specifically prescribed IAP; i.e., \u201ccleared ILS runway one niner approach\u201d or when \u201ccleared approach\u201d i.e., execution of any procedure prescribed for the airport, pilots must execute the entire procedure commencing at an IAF or an associated feeder route as described on the IAP chart unless an appropriate new or revised ATC clearance is received, or the IFR flight plan is canceled.\n\nPilots planning flights to locations which are private airfields or which have instrument approach procedures based on private navigation aids should obtain approval from the owner. In addition, the pilot must be authorized by the FAA to fly special instrument approach procedures associated with private navigation aids (see paragraph 5-4-8). Owners of navigation aids that are not for public use may elect to turn off the signal for whatever reason they may have; for example, maintenance, energy conservation, etc. Air traffic controllers are not required to question pilots to determine if they have permission to land at a private airfield or to use procedures based on privately owned navigation aids, and they may not know the status of the navigation aid. Controllers presume a pilot has obtained approval from the owner and the FAA for use of special instrument approach procedures and is aware of any details of the procedure if an IFR flight plan was filed to that airport.\n\nPilots should not rely on radar to identify a fix unless the fix is indicated as \u201cRADAR\u201d on the IAP. Pilots may request radar identification of an OM, but the controller may not be able to provide the service due either to workload or not having the fix on the video map.\n\nIf a missed approach is required, advise ATC and include the reason (unless initiated by ATC). Comply with the missed approach instructions for the instrument approach procedure being executed, unless otherwise directed by ATC.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-4-21, Missed Approach.\nAIM, Para 5-5-5, Missed Approach."

                "section-content": "A procedure turn is the maneuver prescribed when it is necessary to reverse direction to establish the aircraft inbound on an intermediate or final approach course. The procedure turn or hold-in-lieu-of-PT is a required maneuver when it is depicted on the approach chart, unless cleared by ATC for a straight-in approach. Additionally, the procedure turn or hold-in-lieu-of-PT is not permitted when the symbol \u201cNo PT\u201d is depicted on the initial segment being used, when a RADAR VECTOR to the final approach course is provided, or\u2009when conducting a timed approach from a holding fix. The altitude prescribed for the procedure turn is a minimum altitude until the aircraft is established on the inbound course. The maneuver must be completed within the distance specified in the profile\u2009view. For a hold-in-lieu-of-PT, the holding pattern direction must be flown as depicted and the specified leg length/timing must not be exceeded.\n\nNOTE-\nThe pilot may elect to use the procedure turn or hold-in-lieu-of-PT when it is not required by the procedure, but must first receive an amended clearance from ATC. If the pilot is uncertain whether the ATC clearance intends for a procedure turn to be conducted or to allow for a straight-in approach, the pilot must immediately request\u2009clarification from ATC (14 CFR Section 91.123).\n\nOn U.S. Government charts, a barbed arrow indicates the maneuvering side of the outbound course on which the procedure turn is made. Headings are provided for course reversal using the 45 degree type procedure turn. However, the point at which the turn may be commenced and the type and rate of turn is left to the discretion of the pilot (limited by the charted remain within xx NM distance). Some of the options are the 45 degree procedure turn, the racetrack pattern, the teardrop procedure turn, or the 80 degree \u2194 260\u2009degree course reversal. Racetrack entries should be conducted on the maneuvering side where the majority of protected airspace resides. If an entry places the pilot on the non-maneuvering side of the PT, correction to intercept the outbound course ensures remaining within protected airspace. Some procedure turns are specified by procedural track. These turns must be flown exactly as depicted.\n\n\nDescent to the procedure turn (PT) completion altitude from the PT fix altitude (when one has been published or assigned by ATC) must not begin until crossing over the PT fix or abeam and proceeding outbound. Some procedures contain a note in the chart profile view that says \u201cMaintain (altitude) or above until established outbound for procedure turn\u201d (See FIG 5-4-16). Newer procedures will simply depict an \u201cat or above\u201d altitude at the PT fix without a chart note (See FIG 5-4-17). Both are there to ensure required obstacle clearance is provided in the procedure turn entry zone (See FIG 5-4-18). Absence of a chart note or specified minimum altitude adjacent to the PT fix is an indication that descent to the procedure turn altitude can commence immediately upon crossing over the PT fix, regardless of the direction of flight. This is because the minimum altitudes in the PT entry zone and the PT maneuvering zone are the same.\nFIG 5-4-15Example of an RNAV Approach with RF Leg\nFIG 5-4-16\nFIG 5-4-17\nFIG 5-4-18\n\nWhen the approach procedure involves a procedure turn, a maximum speed of not greater than 200 knots (IAS) should be observed from first overheading the course reversal IAF through the procedure turn maneuver to ensure containment within the obstruction clearance area. Pilots should begin the outbound turn immediately after passing the procedure turn fix. The procedure turn maneuver must be executed within the distance specified in the profile view. The normal procedure turn distance is 10 miles. This may be reduced to a minimum of 5\u2009miles where only Category A or helicopter aircraft are to be operated or increased to as much as 15 miles to accommodate high performance aircraft.\n\nA teardrop procedure or penetration turn may be specified in some procedures for a required course reversal. The teardrop procedure consists of departure from an initial approach fix on an outbound course followed by a turn toward and intercepting the inbound course at or prior to the intermediate fix or point. Its purpose is to permit an aircraft to reverse direction and lose considerable altitude within reasonably limited airspace. Where no fix is available to mark the beginning of the intermediate segment, it must be assumed to commence at a point 10 miles prior to the final approach fix. When the facility is located on the airport, an aircraft is considered to be on final approach upon completion of the penetration turn. However, the final approach segment begins on the final approach course 10 miles from the facility.\n\nA holding pattern in lieu of procedure turn may be specified for course reversal in some procedures. In such cases, the holding pattern is established over an intermediate fix or a final approach fix. The holding pattern distance or time specified in the profile view must be observed. For a hold-in-lieu-of-PT, the holding pattern direction must be flown as depicted and the specified leg length/timing must not be exceeded. Maximum holding airspeed limitations as set forth for all holding patterns apply. The holding pattern maneuver is completed when the aircraft is established on the inbound course after executing the appropriate entry. If cleared for the approach prior to returning to the holding fix, and the aircraft is at the prescribed altitude, additional circuits of the holding pattern are not necessary nor expected by ATC. If pilots elect to make additional circuits to lose excessive altitude or to become better established on course, it is their responsibility to so advise ATC upon receipt of their approach clearance.\n\nA procedure turn is not required when an approach can be made directly from a specified intermediate fix to the final approach fix. In such cases, the term \u201cNoPT\u201d is used with the appropriate course and altitude to denote that the procedure turn is not required. If a procedure turn is desired, and when cleared to do so by ATC, descent below the procedure turn altitude should not be made until the aircraft is established on the inbound course, since some NoPT altitudes may be lower than the procedure turn altitudes.\n\n\nLimitations on Procedure Turns\n\nIn the case of a radar initial approach to a final approach fix or position, or a timed approach from a holding fix, or where the procedure specifies NoPT, no pilot may make a procedure turn unless, when final approach clearance is received, the pilot so advises ATC and a clearance is received to execute a procedure turn.\n\n\nWhen a teardrop procedure turn is depicted and a course reversal is required, this type turn must be executed.\n\nWhen a holding pattern replaces a procedure turn, the holding pattern must be followed, except when RADAR VECTORING is provided or when NoPT is shown on the approach course. The recommended entry procedures will ensure the aircraft remains within the holding pattern's protected airspace. As in the procedure turn, the descent from the minimum holding pattern altitude to the final approach fix altitude (when lower) may not commence until the aircraft is established on the inbound course. Where a holding pattern is established in-lieu-of a procedure turn, the maximum holding pattern airspeeds apply.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-3-8j2, Holding.\n\n\nThe absence of the procedure turn barb in the plan view indicates that a procedure turn is not authorized for that procedure."

(14 CFR Section\u200991.175.)\n\n\nAlthough the controller will not specifically state that \u201ctimed approaches are in use,\u201d the assigning of a time to depart the final approach fix inbound (nonprecision approach) or the outer marker or fix used in lieu of the outer marker inbound (precision approach) is indicative that timed approach procedures are being utilized, or in lieu of holding, the controller may use radar vectors to the Final Approach Course to establish a mileage interval between aircraft that will ensure the appropriate time sequence between the final approach fix/outer marker or fix used in lieu of the outer marker and the airport.\n\nEach pilot in an approach sequence will be given advance notice as to the time they should leave the holding point on approach to the airport. When a time to leave the holding point has been received, the pilot should adjust the flight path to leave the fix as closely as possible to the designated time. (See FIG 5-4-19.)\nFIG 5-4-19Timed Approaches from a Holding Fix\n\nEXAMPLE-\nAt 12:03 local time, in the example shown, a pilot holding, receives instructions to leave the fix inbound at 12:07. These instructions are received just as the pilot has completed turn at the outbound end of the holding pattern and is proceeding inbound towards the fix. Arriving back over the fix, the pilot notes that the time is 12:04 and that there are 3 minutes to lose in order to leave the fix at the assigned time. Since the time remaining is more than two minutes, the pilot plans to fly a race track pattern rather than a 360 degree turn, which would use up 2 minutes. The turns at the ends of the race track pattern will consume approximately 2 minutes. Three minutes to go, minus 2 minutes required for the turns, leaves 1 minute for level flight. Since two portions of level flight will be required to get back to the fix inbound, the pilot halves the 1 minute remaining and plans to fly level for 30 seconds outbound before starting the turn back to the fix on final approach. If the winds were negligible at flight altitude, this procedure would bring the pilot inbound across the fix precisely at the specified time of 12:07. However, if expecting headwind on final approach, the pilot should shorten the 30 second outbound course somewhat, knowing that the wind will carry the aircraft away from the fix faster while outbound and decrease the ground speed while returning to the fix. On the other hand, compensating for a tailwind on final approach, the pilot should lengthen the calculated 30 second outbound heading somewhat, knowing that the wind would tend to hold the aircraft closer to the fix while outbound and increase the ground speed while returning to the fix."

The radar controller vectors the aircraft to align it with the runway centerline. The controller continues the vectors to keep the aircraft on course until the pilot can complete the approach and landing by visual reference to the surface. There are two types of radar approaches: Precision (PAR) and Surveillance (ASR).\n\n\nA radar approach may be given to any aircraft upon request and may be offered to pilots of aircraft in distress or to expedite traffic, however, an ASR might not be approved unless there is an ATC operational requirement, or in an unusual or emergency situation. Acceptance of a PAR or ASR by a pilot does not waive the prescribed weather minimums for the airport or for the particular aircraft operator concerned. The decision to make a radar approach when the reported weather is below the established minimums rests with the pilot.\n\nPAR and ASR minimums are published on separate pages in the FAA Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP).\n\nPrecision Approach (PAR). A PAR is one in which a controller provides highly accurate navigational guidance in azimuth and elevation to a pilot.

If an aircraft is observed by the controller to proceed outside of specified safety zone limits in azimuth and/or elevation and continue to operate outside these prescribed limits, the pilot will be directed to execute a missed approach or to fly a specified course unless the pilot has the runway environment (runway, approach lights, etc.) in sight. Navigational guidance in azimuth and elevation is provided the pilot until the aircraft reaches the published Decision Height (DH). Advisory course and glidepath information is furnished by the controller until the aircraft passes over the landing threshold, at which point the pilot is advised of any deviation from the runway centerline. Radar service is automatically terminated upon completion of the approach.\n\n\nSurveillance Approach (ASR). An ASR is one in which a controller provides navigational guidance in azimuth only. The pilot is furnished headings to fly to align the aircraft with the extended centerline of the landing runway. Since the radar information used for a surveillance approach is considerably less precise than that used for a precision approach, the accuracy of the approach will not be as great and higher minimums will apply. Guidance in elevation is not possible but the pilot will be advised when to commence descent to the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) or, if appropriate, to an intermediate step-down fix Minimum Crossing Altitude and subsequently to the prescribed MDA. In addition, the pilot will be advised of the location of the Missed Approach Point (MAP) prescribed for the procedure and the aircraft's position each mile on final from the runway, airport or heliport or MAP, as appropriate. If requested by the pilot, recommended altitudes will be issued at each mile, based on the descent gradient established for the procedure, down to the last mile that is at or above the MDA. Normally, navigational guidance will be provided until the aircraft reaches the MAP. Controllers will terminate guidance and instruct the pilot to execute a missed approach unless at the MAP the pilot has the runway, airport or heliport in sight or, for a helicopter point-in-space approach, the prescribed visual reference with the surface is established. Also, if, at any time during the approach the controller considers that safe guidance for the remainder of the approach cannot be provided, the controller will terminate guidance and instruct the pilot to execute a missed approach. Similarly, guidance termination and missed approach will be effected upon pilot request and, for civil aircraft only, controllers may terminate guidance when the pilot reports the runway, airport/heliport or visual surface route (point-in-space approach) in sight or otherwise indicates that continued guidance is not required. Radar service is automatically terminated at the completion of a radar approach.\n\nNOTE-\nThe published MDA for straight-in approaches will be issued to the pilot before beginning descent. When a surveillance approach will terminate in a circle-to-land maneuver, the pilot must furnish the aircraft approach category to the controller. The controller will then provide the pilot with the appropriate MDA.\n\nNO-GYRO Approach. This approach is available to a pilot under radar control who experiences circumstances wherein the directional gyro or other stabilized compass is inoperative or inaccurate. When this occurs, the pilot should so advise ATC and request a No-Gyro vector or approach. Pilots of aircraft not equipped with a directional gyro or other stabilized compass who desire radar handling may also request a No-Gyro vector or approach. The pilot should make all turns at standard rate and should execute the turn immediately upon receipt of instructions. For example, \u201cTURN RIGHT,\u201d \u201cSTOP TURN.\u201d When a surveillance or precision approach is made, the pilot will be advised after the aircraft has been turned onto final approach to make turns at half standard rate."

                "section-content": "ATC procedures permit ILS/RNAV/GLS instrument approach operations to dual or triple parallel runway configurations. ILS/RNAV/GLS approaches to parallel runways are grouped into three classes: Simultaneous Dependent Approaches; Simultaneous Independent Approaches; and Simultaneous Close Parallel PRM Approaches. RNAV approach procedures that are approved for simultaneous operations require GPS as the sensor for position updating. VOR/DME, DME/DME and IRU RNAV updating is not authorized. The classification of a parallel runway approach procedure is dependent on adjacent parallel runway centerline separation, ATC procedures, and airport ATC final approach radar monitoring and communications capabilities. At some airports, one or more approach courses may be offset up to 3 degrees. ILS approaches with offset localizer configurations result in loss of Category II/III capabilities and an increase in decision altitude/height (50').\n\n\nDepending on weather conditions, traffic volume, and the specific combination of runways being utilized for arrival operations, a runway may be used for different types of simultaneous operations, including closely spaced dependent or independent approaches. Pilots should ensure that they understand the type of operation that is being conducted, and ask ATC for clarification if necessary.\n\nParallel approach operations demand heightened pilot situational awareness. A thorough Approach Procedure Chart review should be conducted with, as a minimum, emphasis on the following approach chart information: name and number of the approach, localizer frequency, inbound localizer/azimuth course, glideslope/glidepath intercept altitude, glideslope crossing altitude at the final approach fix, decision height, missed approach instructions, special notes/procedures, and the assigned runway location/proximity to adjacent runways. Pilots are informed by ATC or through the ATIS that simultaneous approaches are in use.\n\nThe close proximity of adjacent aircraft conducting simultaneous independent approaches, especially simultaneous close parallel PRM approaches mandates strict pilot compliance with all ATC clearances. ATC assigned airspeeds, altitudes, and headings must be complied with in a timely manner. Autopilot coupled approaches require pilot knowledge of procedures necessary to comply with ATC instructions. Simultaneous independent approaches, particularly simultaneous close parallel PRM approaches necessitate precise approach course tracking to minimize final monitor controller intervention, and unwanted No Transgression Zone (NTZ) penetration. In the unlikely event of a breakout, ATC will not assign altitudes lower than the minimum vectoring altitude. Pilots should notify ATC immediately if there is a degradation of aircraft or navigation systems.\n\nStrict radio discipline is mandatory during simultaneous independent and simultaneous close parallel PRM approach operations. This includes an alert listening watch and the avoidance of lengthy, unnecessary radio transmissions. Attention must be given to proper call sign usage to prevent the inadvertent execution of clearances intended for another aircraft. Use of abbreviated call signs must be avoided to preclude confusion of aircraft with similar sounding call signs. Pilots must be alert to unusually long periods of silence or any unusual background sounds in their radio receiver. A stuck microphone may block the issuance of ATC instructions on the tower frequency by the final monitor controller during simultaneous independent and simultaneous close parallel PRM approaches. In the case of PRM approaches, the use of a second frequency by the monitor controller mitigates the \u201cstuck mike\u201d or other blockage on the tower frequency.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Chapter 4, Section 2, Radio Communications Phraseology and Techniques, gives additional communications information.\n\n\nUse of Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) provides an additional element of safety to parallel approach operations. Pilots should follow recommended TCAS operating procedures presented in approved flight manuals, original equipment manufacturer recommendations, professional newsletters, and FAA publications."

RNAV equipment in the aircraft or GLS equipment on the ground and in the aircraft may replace the required airborne and ground based ILS equipment. Although non-precision minimums may be published, pilots must only use those procedures specifically authorized by chart note. For example, the chart note \u201cLNAV NA during simultaneous operations,\u201d requires vertical guidance. When given a choice, pilots should always fly a precision approach whenever possible.\n\n\nA simultaneous dependent approach differs from a simultaneous independent approach in that, the minimum distance between parallel runway centerlines may be reduced; there is no requirement for radar monitoring or advisories; and a staggered separation of aircraft on the adjacent final course is required.\n\nA minimum of 1.0 NM radar separation (diagonal) is required between successive aircraft on the adjacent final approach course when runway centerlines are at least 2,500 feet but no more than 3,600 feet apart. A minimum of 1.5 NM radar separation (diagonal) is required between successive aircraft on the adjacent final approach course when runway centerlines are more than 3,600 feet but no more than 8,300 feet apart. When runway centerlines are more than 8,300 feet but no more than 9,000 feet apart a minimum of 2 NM diagonal radar separation is provided. Aircraft on the same final approach course within 10 NM of the runway end are provided a minimum of 3 NM radar separation, reduced to 2.5\u2009NM in certain circumstances. In addition, a minimum of 1,000 feet vertical or a minimum of three miles radar separation is provided between aircraft during turn on to the parallel final approach course.\n\nWhenever parallel approaches are in use, pilots are informed by ATC or via the ATIS that approaches to both runways are in use. The charted IAP also notes which runways may be used simultaneously. In addition, the radar controller will have the interphone capability of communicating with the tower controller where separation responsibility has not been delegated to the tower.\n\nNOTE-\nATC will not specifically identify these operations as being dependent when advertised on the ATIS.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nSimultaneous ILS Runway 19 right and ILS Runway 19 left in use.\nAt certain airports, simultaneous dependent approaches are permitted to runways spaced less than 2,500 feet apart. In this case, ATC will provide no less than the minimum authorized diagonal separation with the leader always arriving on the same runway. The trailing aircraft is permitted reduced diagonal separation, instead of the single runway separation normally utilized for runways spaced less than 2,500 feet apart. For wake turbulence mitigation reasons:\n\nReduced diagonal spacing is only permitted when certain aircraft wake category pairings exist; typically when the leader is either in the large or small wake turbulence category, and\n\n\nAll aircraft must descend on the glideslope from the altitude at which they were cleared for the approach during these operations.\nWhen reduced separation is authorized, the IAP briefing strip indicates that simultaneous operations require the use of vertical guidance and that the pilot should maintain last assigned altitude until intercepting the glideslope. No special pilot training is required to participate in these operations.\nNOTE-\nEither simultaneous dependent approaches with reduced separation or SOIA PRM approaches may be conducted to Runways 28R and 28L at KSFO spaced 750 feet apart, depending on weather conditions and traffic volume. Pilots should use caution so as not to confuse these operations. Plan for SOIA procedures only when ATC assigns a PRM approach or the ATIS advertises PRM approaches are in use.

PRM is also published in the title as part of the approach name for IAPs used to conduct Simultaneous Close Parallel approaches. \u201cPRM\u201d alerts pilots that specific airborne equipment, training, and procedures are applicable.\nBecause Simultaneous Close Parallel PRM approaches are independent, the NTZ and normal operating zone (NOZ) airspace between the final approach courses is monitored by two monitor controllers, one for each approach course. The NTZ monitoring system (final monitor aid) consists of a high resolution ATC radar display with automated tracking software which provides monitor controllers with aircraft identification, position, speed, and a ten-second projected position, as well as visual and aural NTZ penetration alerts. A PRM high update rate surveillance sensor is a component of this system only for specific runway spacing. Additional procedures for simultaneous independent approaches are described in paragraph 5-4-15, Simultaneous Independent ILS/RNAV/GLS Approaches.\n\nSimultaneous Close Parallel PRM approaches, whether conducted utilizing a high update rate PRM surveillance sensor or not, must meet all of the following requirements: pilot training, PRM in the approach title, NTZ monitoring utilizing a final monitor aid, radar display, publication of an AAUP, and use of a secondary PRM communications frequency.

Also, in the event of the loss of ground-based NAVAIDS, the ATIS may advertise other types of PRM approaches to the affected runway or runways.\n\n\nThe Attention All Users Page (AAUP) will address procedures for conducting PRM approaches.\n\n\nRequirements and Procedures. Besides system requirements and pilot procedures as identified in subparagraph a1 above, all pilots must have completed special training before accepting a clearance to conduct a PRM approach.\n\nPilot Training Requirement. Pilots must complete special pilot training, as outlined below, before accepting a clearance for a simultaneous close parallel PRM approach.\n\nFor operations under 14 CFR Parts 121, 129, and 135, pilots must comply with FAA-approved company training as identified in their Operations Specifications. Training includes the requirement for pilots to view the FAA training slide presentation, \u201cPrecision Runway Monitor (PRM) Pilot Procedures.\u201d Refer to https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/training/prm/ or search key words \u201cFAA PRM\u201d for additional information and to view or download the slide presentation.\n\n\nFor operations under Part 91:\n\nPilots operating transport category aircraft must be familiar with PRM operations as contained in this section of the AIM.

Use PRM procedures only when the ATIS advertises their use. For other types of simultaneous  approaches, see paragraphs 5-4-14 and 5-4-15.\n\n\nATC Directed Breakout. An ATC directed \u201cbreakout\u201d is defined as a vector off the final approach course of a threatened aircraft in response to another aircraft penetrating the NTZ.\n\nDual Communications. The aircraft flying the PRM approach must have the capability of enabling the pilot/s to listen to two communications frequencies simultaneously. To avoid blocked transmissions, each runway will have two frequencies, a primary and a PRM monitor frequency. The tower controller will transmit on both frequencies. The monitor controller's transmissions, if needed, will override both frequencies. Pilots will ONLY transmit on the tower controller's frequency, but will listen to both frequencies. Select the PRM monitor frequency audio only when instructed by ATC to contact the tower. The volume levels should be set about the same on both radios so that the pilots will be able to hear transmissions on the PRM frequency if the tower is blocked. Site-specific procedures take precedence over the general information presented in this paragraph. Refer to the AAUP for applicable procedures at specific airports.\n\nRadar Services.\n\nDuring turn on to parallel final approach, aircraft will be provided 3 miles radar separation or a minimum of 1,000 feet vertical separation.

At airports that conduct PRM operations, the AAUP informs pilots under the \u201cGeneral\u201d section of information relative to all the PRM approaches published at a specific airport, and this section must be briefed in its entirety. Under the \u201cRunway Specific\u201d section, only items relative to the runway to be used for landing need be briefed. (See FIG 5-4-24.) A single AAUP is utilized for multiple PRM approach charts at the same airport, which are listed on the AAUP. The requirement for informing ATC if the pilot is unable to accept a PRM clearance is also presented. The \u201cGeneral\u201d section of AAUP addresses the following:\n\nReview of the procedure for executing a climbing or descending breakout;\n\n\nBreakout phraseology beginning with the words, \u201cTraffic Alert;\u201d\n\nDescending on the glideslope/glidepath meets all crossing restrictions;\n\nBriefing the PRM approach also satisfies the non-PRM approach briefing of the same type of approach to the same runway; and\n\nDescription of the dual communications procedure.\nThe \u201cRunway Specific\u201d section of the AAUP addresses those issues which only apply to certain runway ends that utilize PRM approaches. There may be no Runway Specific procedures, a single item applicable to only one runway end, or multiple items for a single or multiple runway end/s. Examples of SOIA runway specific procedures are as follows:FIG 5-4-24PRM Attention All Users Page (AAUP)\n\nSimultaneous Offset Instrument Approach (SOIA).\n\nSOIA is a procedure used to conduct simultaneous approaches to runways spaced less than 3,000 feet, but at least 750 feet apart. The SOIA procedure utilizes a straight-in PRM approach to one runway, and a PRM offset approach with glideslope/glidepath to the adjacent runway. In SOIA operations, aircraft are paired, with the aircraft conducting the straight-in PRM approach always positioned slightly ahead of the aircraft conducting the offset PRM approach.\n\n\nThe straight-in PRM approach plates used in SOIA operations are identical to other straight-in PRM approach plates, with an additional note, which provides the separation between the two runways used for simultaneous SOIA approaches. The offset PRM approach plate displays the required notations for closely spaced approaches as well as depicts the visual segment of the approach.\n\nControllers monitor the SOIA PRM approaches in exactly the same manner as is done for other PRM approaches. The procedures and system requirements for SOIA PRM approaches are identical with those used for simultaneous close parallel PRM approaches until near the offset PRM approach missed approach point (MAP), where visual acquisition of the straight-in aircraft by the aircraft conducting the offset PRM approach occurs. Since SOIA PRM approaches are identical to other PRM approaches (except for the visual segment in the offset approach), an understanding of the procedures for conducting PRM approaches is essential before conducting a SOIA PRM operation.\n\nIn SOIA, the approach course separation (instead of the runway separation) meets established close parallel approach criteria. (See FIG 5-4-25 for the generic SOIA approach geometry.) A visual segment of the offset PRM approach is established between the offset MAP and the runway threshold. Aircraft transition in visual conditions from the offset course, beginning at the offset MAP, to align with the runway and can be stabilized by 500 feet above ground level (AGL) on the extended runway centerline. A cloud ceiling for the approach is established so that the aircraft conducting the offset approach has nominally at least 30 seconds or more to acquire the leading straight-in aircraft prior to reaching the offset MAP. If visual acquisition is not accomplished prior to crossing the offset MAP, a missed approach must be executed.\n\nFlight Management System (FMS) coding of the offset RNAV PRM and GLS PRM approaches in a SOIA operation is different than other RNAV and GLS approach coding in that it does not match the initial missed approach procedure published on the charted IAP. In the SOIA design of the offset approach, lateral course guidance terminates at the fictitious threshold point (FTP), which is an extension of the final approach course beyond the offset MAP to a point near the runway threshold. The FTP is designated in the approach coding as the MAP so that vertical guidance is available to the pilot to the runway threshold, just as vertical guidance is provided by the offset LDA glideslope. No matter what type of offset approach is being conducted, reliance on lateral guidance is discontinued at the charted MAP and replaced by visual maneuvering to accomplish runway alignment.\n\nAs a result of this approach coding, when executing a missed approach at and after passing the charted offset MAP, a heading must initially be flown (either hand-flown or using autopilot \u201cheading mode\u201d) before engaging LNAV. If the pilot engages LNAV immediately, the aircraft may continue to track toward the FTP instead of commencing a turn toward the missed approach holding fix. Notes on the charted IAP and in the AAUP make specific reference to this procedure.\n\n\nSome FMSs do not code waypoints inside of the FAF as part of the approach. Therefore, the depicted MAP on the charted IAP may not be included in the offset approach coding. Pilots utilizing those FMSs may identify the location of the waypoint by noting its distance from the FTP as published on the charted IAP. In those same FMSs, the straight-in SOIA approach will not display a waypoint inside the PFAF. The same procedures may be utilized to identify an uncoded waypoint. In this case, the location is determined by noting its distance from the runway waypoint or using an authorized distance as published on the charted IAP.\n\nBecause the FTP is coded as the MAP, the FMS map display will depict the initial missed approach course as beginning at the FTP. This depiction does not match the charted initial missed approach procedure on the IAP. Pilots are reminded that charted IAP guidance is to be followed, not the map display. Once the aircraft completes the initial turn when commencing a missed approach, the remainder of the procedure coding is standard and can be utilized as with any other IAP.\nFIG 5-4-25SOIA Approach Geometry\n\nNOTE-\n\n\nSAP\n\n\nThe stabilized approach point is a design point along the extended centerline of the intended landing runway on the glide slope/glide path at 500 feet above the runway threshold elevation. It is used to verify a sufficient distance is provided for the visual maneuver after the offset course approach DA to permit the pilots to conform to approved, stabilized approach criteria. The SAP is not published on the IAP.\n\n\n\n\nOffset Course DA\n\n\nThe point along the LDA, or other offset course, where the course separation with the adjacent ILS, or other straight-in course, reaches the minimum distance permitted to conduct closely spaced approaches. Typically that minimum distance will be 3,000 feet without the use of high update radar; with high update radar, course separation of less than 3,000 ft may be used when validated by a safety study. The altitude of the glide slope/glide path at that point determines the offset course approach decision altitude and is where the NTZ terminates. Maneuvering inside the DA is done in visual conditions.\n\n\n\n\nVisual Segment Angle\n\n\nAngle, as determined by the SOIA design tool, formed by the extension of the straight segment of the calculated flight track (between the offset course MAP/DA and the SAP) and the extended runway centerline. The size of the angle is dependent on the aircraft approach categories (Category D or only selected categories/speeds) that are authorized to use the offset course approach and the spacing between the runways.\n\n\n\n\nVisibility\n\n\nDistance from the offset course approach DA to runway threshold in statute mile.\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nThe aircraft on the offset course approach must see the runway-landing environment and, if ATC has advised that traffic on the straight-in approach is a factor, the offset course approach aircraft must visually acquire the straight-in approach aircraft and report it in sight to ATC prior to reaching the DA for the offset course approach.\n\n\n\n\nCC\n\n\nThe Clear of Clouds point is the position on the offset final approach course where aircraft first operate in visual meteorological conditions below the ceiling, when the actual weather conditions are at, or near, the minimum ceiling for SOIA operations. Ceiling is defined by the Aeronautical Information Manual.\n\n\n\nSOIA PRM approaches utilize the same dual communications procedures as do other PRM approaches.\n\nNOTE-\nAt KSFO, pilots conducting SOIA operations select the monitor frequency audio when communicating with the final radar controller, not the tower controller as is customary. In this special case, the monitor controller's transmissions, if required, override the final controller's frequency. This procedure is addressed on the AAUP.\n\nSOIA utilizes the same AAUP format as do other PRM approaches. The minimum weather conditions that are required are listed. Because of the more complex nature of instructions for conducting SOIA approaches, the \u201cRunway Specific\u201d items are more numerous and lengthy.\n\n\nExamples of SOIA offset runway specific notes:\n\nAircraft must remain on the offset course until passing the offset MAP prior to maneuvering to align with the centerline of the offset approach runway.\n\n\nPilots are authorized to continue past the offset MAP to align with runway centerline when:\n\nthe straight-in approach traffic is in sight and is expected to remain in sight,\n\n\nATC has been advised that \u201ctraffic is in sight.\u201d (ATC is not required to acknowledge this transmission),\n\nthe runway environment is in sight. Otherwise, a missed approach must be executed. Between the offset MAP and the runway threshold, pilots conducting the offset PRM approach must not pass the straight-in aircraft and are responsible for separating themselves visually from traffic conducting the straight-in PRM approach to the adjacent runway, which means maneuvering the aircraft as necessary to avoid that traffic until landing, and providing wake turbulence avoidance, if applicable. Pilots maintaining visual separation should advise ATC, as soon as practical, if visual contact with the aircraft conducting the straight-in PRM approach is lost and execute a missed approach unless otherwise instructed by ATC.\n\nExamples of SOIA straight-in runway specific notes:\n\nTo facilitate the offset aircraft in providing wake mitigation, pilots should descend on, not above, the glideslope/glidepath.\n\n\nConducting the straight-in approach, pilots should be aware that the aircraft conducting the offset approach will be approaching from the right/left rear and will be operating in close proximity to the straight-in aircraft.\n\nRecap.\nThe following are differences between widely spaced simultaneous approaches (at least 4,300 feet between the runway centerlines) and Simultaneous PRM close parallel approaches which are of importance to the pilot:\nRunway Spacing. Prior to PRM simultaneous close parallel approaches, most ATC-directed breakouts were the result of two aircraft in-trail on the same final approach course getting too close together. Two aircraft going in the same direction did not mandate quick reaction times. With PRM closely spaced approaches, two aircraft could be alongside each other, navigating on courses that are separated by less than 4,300 feet and as close as 3,000 feet. In the unlikely event that an aircraft \u201cblunders\u201d off its course and makes a worst case turn of 30 degrees toward the adjacent final approach course, closing speeds of 135 feet per second could occur that constitute the need for quick reaction. A blunder has to be recognized by the monitor controller, and breakout instructions issued to the endangered aircraft. The pilot will not have any warning that a breakout is imminent because the blundering aircraft will be on another frequency. It is important that, when a pilot receives breakout instructions, the assumption is made that a blundering aircraft is about to (or has penetrated the NTZ) and is heading toward his/her approach course. The pilot must initiate a breakout as soon as safety allows. While conducting PRM approaches, pilots must maintain an increased sense of awareness in order to immediately react to an ATC (breakout) instruction and maneuver (as instructed by ATC) away from a blundering aircraft.\n\n\nCommunications. Dual VHF communications procedures should be carefully followed. One of the assumptions made that permits the safe conduct of PRM approaches is that there will be no blocked communications.\n\nHand-flown Breakouts. The use of the autopilot is encouraged while flying a PRM approach, but the autopilot must be disengaged in the rare event that a breakout is issued. Simulation studies of breakouts have shown that a hand-flown breakout can be initiated consistently faster than a breakout performed using the autopilot.\n\nTCAS. The ATC breakout instruction is the primary means of conflict resolution. TCAS, if installed, provides another form of conflict resolution in the unlikely event other separation standards would fail. TCAS is not required to conduct a closely spaced approach.\nThe TCAS provides only vertical resolution of aircraft conflicts, while the ATC breakout instruction provides both vertical and horizontal guidance for conflict resolutions. Pilots should always immediately follow the TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA), whenever it is received. Should a TCAS RA be received before, during, or after an ATC breakout instruction is issued, the pilot should follow the RA, even if it conflicts with the climb/descent portion of the breakout maneuver. If following an RA requires deviating from an ATC clearance, the pilot must advise ATC as soon as practical. While following an RA, it is extremely important that the pilot also comply with the turn portion of the ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot determines safety to be factor. Adhering to these procedures assures the pilot that acceptable \u201cbreakout\u201d separation margins will always be provided, even in the face of a normal procedural or system failure."

All operators require specific authorization from the FAA to fly any RNP AR approach or departure procedure. The FAA issues RNP AR authorization via operations specification (OpSpec), management specification (MSpec), or letter of authorization (LOA). There are no exceptions. Operators can find comprehensive information on RNP AR aircraft eligibility, operating procedures, and training requirements in AC 90-101, Approval Guidance for RNP Procedures with AR.\n\n\nUnique characteristics of RNP AR Operations Approach title. The FAA titles all RNP AR instrument approach procedures (IAP) as \u201cRNAV (RNP) RWY XX.\u201d Internationally, operators may find RNP AR IAPs titled \u201cRNP RWY XX (AR).\u201d All RNP AR procedures will clearly state \u201cAuthorization Required\u201d on the procedure chart.\n\nRNP value. RNP AR procedures are characterized by use of a lateral Obstacle Evaluation Area (OEA) equal to two times the RNP value (2 x RNP) in nautical miles. No secondary lateral OEA or additional buffers are used. RNP AR procedures require a minimum lateral accuracy value of RNP 0.30. Each published line of minima in an RNP AR procedure has an associated RNP value that defines the procedure's lateral performance requirement in the Final Approach Segment. Each approved RNP AR operator's FAA-issued authorization will identify a minimum authorized RNP approach value. This value may vary depending on aircraft configuration or operational procedures (e.g., use of flight director or autopilot).\n\nRadius-to-fix (RF) legs. Many RNP AR IFPs contain RF legs. Aircraft eligibility for RF legs is required in any authorization for RNP AR operations.\n\nMissed Approach RNP value less than 1.00 NM. Some RNP AR IFPs require an RNP lateral accuracy value of less than 1.00 NM in the missed approach segment. The operator's FAA-issued RNP AR authorization will specify whether the operator may fly a missed approach procedure requiring a lateral accuracy value less than 1.00 NM. AC 90-101 identifies specific operating procedures and training requirements applicable to this aspect of RNP AR procedures.\n\nNon-standard speeds or climb gradients. RNP AR approaches may require non-standard approach speeds and/or missed approach climb gradients. RNP AR approach charts will reflect any non-standard requirements and pilots must confirm they can meet those requirements before commencing the approach.\n\nRNP AR Departure Procedures (RNP AR DP). RNP AR approach authorization is a mandatory prerequisite for an operator to be eligible to perform RNP AR DPs. RNP AR DPs can utilize a minimum RNP value of RNP 0.30, may include higher than standard climb gradients, and may include RF turns. Close in RF turns associated with RNP AR DPs may begin as soon as the departure end of the runway (DER). For specific eligibility guidance, operators should refer to AC 90-101.\nFIG 5-4-26Example of an RNP AR DP"

Circling approach protected areas developed prior to late 2012 used fixed radius distances, dependent on aircraft approach category, as shown in the table on page B2 of the U.S. TPP. The approaches using standard circling approach areas can be identified by the absence of the \u201cnegative C\" symbol on the circling line of minima. Circling approach protected areas developed after late 2012 use the radius distance shown in the table on page B2 of the U.S. TPP, dependent on aircraft approach category, and the altitude of the circling MDA, which accounts for true airspeed increase with altitude. The approaches using expanded circling approach areas can be identified by the presence of the \u201cnegative C\" symbol on the circling line of minima (see FIG 5-4-28). Because of obstacles near the airport, a portion of the circling area may be restricted by a procedural note; for example, \u201cCircling NA E of RWY 17-35.\u201d Obstacle clearance is provided at the published minimums (MDA) for the pilot who makes a straight-in approach, side-steps, or circles. Once below the MDA the pilot must see and avoid obstacles. Executing the missed approach after starting to maneuver usually places the aircraft beyond the MAP. The aircraft is clear of obstacles when at or above the MDA while inside the circling area, but simply joining the missed approach ground track from the circling maneuver may not provide vertical obstacle clearance once the aircraft exits the circling area. Additional climb inside the circling area may be required before joining the missed approach track. See paragraph 5-4-21, Missed Approach, for additional considerations when starting a missed approach at other than the MAP.\nFIG 5-4-27Final Approach Obstacle Clearance\n\nNOTE-\nCircling approach area radii vary according to approach category and MSL circling altitude due to TAS changes\u2014see\u2009FIG 5-4-28.\nFIG 5-4-28Standard and Expanded Circling Approach Radii in the U.S. TPP\n\n\nPrecision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ). A volume of airspace above an area beginning at the runway threshold, at the threshold elevation, and centered on the extended runway centerline. The POFZ is 200 feet (60m) long and 800 feet (240m) wide. The POFZ must be clear when an aircraft on a vertically guided final approach is within 2 nautical miles of the runway threshold and the official weather observation is a ceiling below 250 feet or visibility less than 3/4 statute mile (SM) (or runway visual range below 4,000 feet). If the POFZ is not clear, the MINIMUM authorized height above touchdown (HAT) and visibility is 250\u2009feet and 3/4 SM. The POFZ is considered clear even if the wing of the aircraft holding on a taxiway waiting for runway clearance penetrates the POFZ; however, neither the fuselage nor the tail may infringe on the POFZ. The POFZ is applicable at all runway ends including displaced thresholds.\nFIG 5-4-29Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ)\n\nStraight-in Minimums are shown on the IAP when the final approach course is within 30 degrees of the runway alignment and a normal descent can be made from the IFR altitude shown on the IAP to the runway surface. When either the normal rate of descent or the runway alignment factor of 30 degrees is exceeded, a straight-in minimum is not published and a circling minimum applies. The fact that a straight-in minimum is not published does not preclude pilots from landing straight-in if they have the active runway in sight and have sufficient time to make a normal approach for landing. Under such conditions and when ATC has cleared them for landing on that runway, pilots are not expected to circle even though only circling minimums are published. If they desire to circle, they should advise ATC.\n\nSide-Step Maneuver Minimums. Landing minimums for a side-step maneuver to the adjacent runway will normally be higher than the minimums to the primary runway.\n\nPublished Approach Minimums. Approach minimums are published for different aircraft categories and consist of a minimum altitude (DA, DH, MDA) and required visibility. These minimums are determined by applying the appropriate TERPS criteria. When a fix is incorporated in a nonprecision final segment, two sets of minimums may be published: one for the pilot that is able to identify the fix, and a second for the pilot that cannot. Two sets of minimums may also be published when a second altimeter source is used in the procedure. When a nonprecision procedure incorporates both a stepdown fix in the final segment and a second altimeter source, two sets of minimums are published to account for the stepdown fix and a note addresses minimums for the second altimeter source.\n\nCircling Minimums. In some busy terminal areas, ATC may not allow circling and circling minimums will not be published. Published circling minimums provide obstacle clearance when pilots remain within the appropriate area of protection. Pilots should remain at or above the circling altitude until the aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers. Circling may require maneuvers at low altitude, at low airspeed, and in marginal weather conditions. Pilots must use sound judgment, have an indepth knowledge of their capabilities, and fully understand the aircraft performance to determine the exact circling maneuver since weather, unique airport design, and the aircraft position, altitude, and airspeed must all be considered. The following basic rules apply:\n\nManeuver the shortest path to the base or downwind leg, as appropriate, considering existing weather conditions. There is no restriction from passing over the airport or other runways.\n\n\nIt should be recognized that circling maneuvers may be made while VFR or other flying is in progress at the airport. Standard left turns or specific instruction from the controller for maneuvering must be considered when circling to land.\n\nAt airports without a control tower, it may be desirable to fly over the airport to observe wind and turn indicators and other traffic which may be on the runway or flying in the vicinity of the airport.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAC 90-66A, Recommended Standards Traffic patterns for Aeronautical Operations at Airports without Operating Control Towers.\n\n\nThe missed approach point (MAP) varies depending upon the approach flown. For vertically guided approaches, the MAP is at the decision altitude/decision height. Non-vertically guided and circling procedures share the same MAP and the pilot determines this MAP by timing from the final approach fix, by a fix, a NAVAID, or a waypoint. Circling from a GLS, an ILS without a localizer line of minima or an RNAV (GPS) approach without an LNAV line of minima is prohibited.\n\nInstrument Approach at a Military Field. When instrument approaches are conducted by civil aircraft at military airports, they must be conducted in accordance with the procedures and minimums approved by the military agency having jurisdiction over the airport."

                "section-content": "When a landing cannot be accomplished, advise ATC and, upon reaching the missed approach point defined on the approach procedure chart, the pilot must comply with the missed approach instructions for the procedure being used or with an alternate missed approach procedure specified by ATC.\n\n\nObstacle protection for missed approach is predicated on the missed approach being initiated at the decision altitude/decision height (DA/DH) or at the missed approach point and not lower than minimum descent altitude (MDA). A climb gradient of at least 200 feet per nautical mile is required, (except for Copter approaches, where a climb of at least 400 feet per nautical mile is required), unless a higher climb gradient is published in the notes section of the approach procedure chart. When higher than standard climb gradients are specified, the end point of the non-standard climb will be specified at either an altitude or a fix. Pilots must preplan to ensure that the aircraft can meet the climb gradient (expressed in feet per nautical mile) required by the procedure in the event of a missed approach, and be aware that flying at a higher than anticipated ground speed increases the climb rate requirement (feet per minute). Tables for the conversion of climb gradients (feet per nautical mile) to climb rate (feet per minute), based on ground speed, are included on page D1 of the U.S. Terminal Procedures booklets. Reasonable buffers are provided for normal maneuvers. However, no consideration is given to an abnormally early turn. Therefore, when an early missed approach is executed, pilots should, unless otherwise cleared by ATC, fly the IAP as specified on the approach plate to the missed approach point at or above the MDA or DH before executing a turning maneuver.\n\nIf visual reference is lost while circling-to-land from an instrument approach, the missed approach specified for that particular procedure must be followed (unless an alternate missed approach procedure is specified by ATC). To become established on the prescribed missed approach course, the pilot should make an initial climbing turn toward the landing runway and continue the turn until established on the missed approach course. Inasmuch as the circling maneuver may be accomplished in more than one direction, different patterns will be required to become established on the prescribed missed approach course, depending on the aircraft position at the time visual reference is lost. Adherence to the procedure will help assure that an aircraft will remain laterally within the circling and missed approach obstruction clearance areas. Refer to paragraph h concerning vertical obstruction clearance when starting a missed approach at other than the MAP. (See FIG 5-4-30.)\n\nAt locations where ATC radar service is provided, the pilot should conform to radar vectors when provided by ATC in lieu of the published missed approach procedure. (See FIG 5-4-31.)\n\nSome locations may have a preplanned alternate missed approach procedure for use in the event the primary NAVAID used for the missed approach procedure is unavailable. To avoid confusion, the alternate missed approach instructions are not published on the chart. However, the alternate missed approach holding pattern will be depicted on the instrument approach chart for pilot situational awareness and to assist ATC by not having to issue detailed holding instructions. The alternate missed approach may be based on NAVAIDs not used in the approach procedure or the primary missed approach. When the alternate missed approach procedure is implemented by NOTAM, it becomes a mandatory part of the procedure. The NOTAM will specify both the textual instructions and any additional equipment requirements necessary to complete the procedure. Air traffic may also issue instructions for the alternate missed approach when necessary, such as when the primary missed approach NAVAID fails during the approach. Pilots may reject an ATC clearance for an alternate missed approach that requires equipment not necessary for the published approach procedure when the alternate missed approach is issued after beginning the approach. However, when the alternate missed approach is issued prior to beginning the approach the pilot must either accept the entire procedure (including the alternate missed approach), request a different approach procedure, or coordinate with ATC for alternative action to be taken, i.e., proceed to an alternate airport, etc.\n\nWhen approach has been missed, request clearance for specific action; i.e., to alternative airport, another approach, etc.\n\nPilots must ensure that they have climbed to a safe altitude prior to proceeding off the published missed approach, especially in nonradar environments. Abandoning the missed approach prior to reaching the published altitude may not provide adequate terrain clearance. Additional climb may be required after reaching the holding pattern before proceeding back to the IAF or to an alternate.\n\nA clearance for an instrument approach procedure includes a clearance to fly the published missed approach procedure, unless otherwise instructed by ATC. The published missed approach procedure provides obstacle clearance only when the missed approach is conducted on the missed approach segment from or above the missed approach point, and assumes a climb rate of 200 feet/NM or higher, as published. If the aircraft initiates a missed approach at a point other than the missed approach point (see paragraph 5-4-5b), from below MDA or DA (H), or on a circling approach, obstacle clearance is not necessarily provided by following the published missed approach procedure, nor is separation assured from other air traffic in the vicinity.\nFIG 5-4-30Circling and Missed Approach Obstruction Clearance Areas\nFIG 5-4-31Missed Approach\nIn the event a balked (rejected) landing occurs at a position other than the published missed approach point, the pilot should contact ATC as soon as possible to obtain an amended clearance. If unable to contact ATC for any reason, the pilot should attempt to re-intercept a published segment of the missed approach and comply with route and altitude instructions. If unable to contact ATC, and in the pilot's judgment it is no longer appropriate to fly the published missed approach procedure, then consider either maintaining visual conditions if practicable and reattempt a landing, or a circle-climb over the airport. Should a missed approach become necessary when operating to an airport that is not served by an operating control tower, continuous contact with an air traffic facility may not be possible. In this case, the pilot should execute the appropriate go-around/missed approach procedure without delay and contact ATC when able to do so.\nPrior to initiating an instrument approach procedure, the pilot should assess the actions to be taken in the event of a balked (rejected) landing beyond the missed approach point or below the MDA or DA (H) considering the anticipated weather conditions and available aircraft performance. 14 CFR 91.175(e) authorizes the pilot to fly an appropriate missed approach procedure that ensures obstruction clearance, but it does not necessarily consider separation from other air traffic. The pilot must consider other factors such as the aircraft's geographical location with respect to the prescribed missed approach point, direction of flight, and/or minimum turning altitudes in the prescribed missed approach procedure. The pilot must also consider aircraft performance, visual climb restrictions, charted obstacles, published obstacle departure procedure, takeoff visual climb requirements as expressed by nonstandard takeoff minima, other traffic expected to be in the vicinity, or other factors not specifically expressed by the approach procedures."

                "section-content": "Introduction. During an instrument approach, an EFVS can enable a pilot to see the approach lights, visual references associated with the runway environment, and other objects or features that might not be visible using natural vision alone. An EFVS uses a head-up display (HUD), or an equivalent display that is a head-up presentation, to combine flight information, flight symbology, navigation guidance, and a real-time image of the external scene to the pilot. Combining the flight information, navigation guidance, and sensor imagery on a HUD (or equivalent display) allows the pilot to continue looking forward along the flightpath throughout the entire approach, landing, and rollout.\nAn EFVS operation is an operation in which visibility conditions require an EFVS to be used in lieu of natural vision to perform an approach or landing, determine enhanced flight visibility, identify required visual references, or conduct a rollout. There are two types of EFVS operations:\nEFVS operations to touchdown and rollout.\n\n\nEFVS operations to 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation (TDZE).\n\n\nEFVS Operations to Touchdown and Rollout. An EFVS operation to touchdown and rollout is an operation in which the pilot uses the enhanced vision imagery provided by an EFVS in lieu of natural vision to descend below DA or DH to touchdown and rollout. (See FIG 5-4-32.) These operations may be conducted only on Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAP) or special IAPs that have a DA or DH (for example, precision or APV approach). An EFVS operation to touchdown and rollout may not be conducted on an approach that has circling minimums. The regulations for EFVS operations to\u2009touchdown and rollout can be found in 14\u2009CFR\u2009\u00a7\u00a091.176(a).\nFIG 5-4-32EFVS Operation to Touchdown and Rollout\n\nEFVS Operations to 100 Feet Above the TDZE. An EFVS operation to 100 feet above the TDZE is an operation in which the pilot uses the enhanced vision imagery provided by an EFVS in lieu of natural vision to descend below DA/DH or MDA down to 100 feet above the TDZE. (See FIG 5-4-33.) To continue the approach below 100\u2009feet above the TDZE, a pilot must have sufficient flight visibility to identify the required visual references using natural vision and must continue to use the EFVS to ensure the enhanced flight visibility meets the visibility requirements of the IAP being flown. These operations may be conducted on SIAPs or special IAPs that have a DA/DH or MDA. An EFVS operation to 100 feet above the TDZE may not be conducted on an approach that has circling minimums. The regulations for EFVS operations to 100 feet above the TDZE can be found in 14\u2009CFR\u2009\u00a7\u00a091.176(b).\nFIG 5-4-33EFVS Operation to 100 ft Above the TDZE\n\nEFVS Equipment Requirements. An EFVS that is installed on a U.S.-registered aircraft and is used to conduct EFVS operations must conform to an FAA-type design approval (i.e., a type certificate (TC), amended TC, or supplemental type certificate (STC)). A foreign-registered aircraft used to conduct EFVS operations that does not have an FAA-type design approval must be equipped with an EFVS that has been approved by either the State of the Operator or the State of Registry to meet the requirements of ICAO Annex 6. Equipment requirements for an EFVS operation to touchdown and rollout can be found in 14 CFR \u00a7\u00a091.176(a)(1), and the equipment requirements for an EFVS operation to 100\u2009feet\u2009above the TDZE can be found in 14\u2009CFR\u2009\u00a7\u00a091.176(b)(1). An operator can determine the eligibility of their aircraft to conduct EFVS operations by referring to the Airplane Flight Manual, Airplane Flight Manual Supplement, Rotorcraft Flight Manual, or Rotorcraft Flight Manual Supplement as applicable.\n\nOperating Requirements. Any operator who conducts EFVS operations to touchdown and rollout (14\u2009CFR\u2009\u00a7\u00a091.176(a)) must have an OpSpec, MSpec, or LOA that specifically authorizes those operations. Parts 91K, 121, 125, 129, and 135 operators who conduct EFVS operations to 100 feet above the TDZE (14\u2009CFR\u2009\u00a7\u00a091.176(b))must have an OpSpec, MSpec, or LOA that specifically authorizes the operation. Part\u200991 operators (other than 91K operators) are not required to have an LOA to conduct EFVS operations to 100 feet above the TDZE in the United States. However, an optional LOA is available to facilitate operational approval from foreign Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA). To conduct an EFVS operation to touchdown and rollout during an authorized Category II or III operation, the operator must have:\n\nAn OpSpec, MSpec, or LOA authorizing EFVS operations to touchdown and rollout (14\u2009CFR\u2009\u00a7\u00a091.176(a)); and\n\n\nAn OpSpec, MSpec, or LOA authorizing Category II or Category III operations.\n\nEFVS Operations in Rotorcraft. Currently, EFVS operations in rotorcraft can only be conducted on IAPs that are flown to a runway. Instrument approach criteria, procedures, and appropriate visual references have not yet been developed for straight-in landing operations below DA/DH or MDA under IFR to heliports or platforms. An EFVS cannot be used in lieu of natural vision to descend below published minimums on copter approaches to a point in space (PinS) followed by a \u201cproceed visual flight rules (VFR)\u201d visual segment, or on approaches designed to a specific landing site using a \u201cproceed visually\u201d visual segment.\n\nEFVS Pilot Requirements. A pilot who conducts EFVS operations must receive ground and flight training specific to the EFVS operation to be conducted. The training must be obtained from an authorized training provider under a training program approved by the FAA. Additionally, recent flight experience and proficiency or competency check requirements apply to EFVS operations. These requirements are addressed in 14\u2009CFR \u00a7\u00a7\u00a061.66, 91.1065, 121.441, Appendix F to Part 121, 125.287, and 135.293.\n\nEnhanced Flight Visibility and Visual Reference Requirements. To descend below DA/DH or MDA during EFVS operations under 14\u2009CFR \u00a7\u00a091.176(a) or (b), a pilot must make a determination that the enhanced flight visibility observed by using an EFVS is not less than what is prescribed by the IAP being flown. In addition, the visual references required in 14 CFR \u00a7\u00a091.176(a) or (b) must be distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot using the EFVS. The determination of enhanced flight visibility is a separate action from that of identifying required visual references, and is different from ground-reported visibility. Even though the reported visibility or the visibility observed using natural vision may be less, as long as the EFVS provides the required enhanced flight visibility and a pilot meets all of the other requirements, the pilot can continue descending below DA/DH or MDA using the EFVS. Suitable enhanced flight visibility is necessary to ensure the aircraft is in a position to continue the approach and land. It is important to understand that using an EFVS does not result in obtaining lower minima with respect to the visibility or the DA/DH or MDA specified in the IAP. An EFVS simply provides another means of operating in the visual segment of an IAP. The DA/DH or MDA and the visibility value specified in the IAP to be flown do not change.\n\nFlight Planning and Beginning or Continuing an Approach Under IFR. A Part 121, 125, or 135 operator's OpSpec or LOA for EFVS operations may authorize an EFVS operational credit dispatching or releasing a flight and for beginning or continuing an instrument approach procedure. When a pilot reaches DA/DH or MDA, the pilot conducts the EFVS operation in accordance with 14\u2009CFR\u2009\u00a7\u00a091.176(a) or (b) and their authorization to conduct EFVS operations.\n\nMissed Approach Considerations. In order to conduct an EFVS operation, the EFVS must be operable. In the event of a failure of any required component of an EFVS at any point in the approach to touchdown, a missed approach is required. However, this provision does not preclude a pilot's authority to continue an approach if continuation of an approach is considered by the pilot to be a safer course of action.\n\nLight Emitting Diode (LED) Airport Lighting Impact on EFVS Operations. Incandescent lamps are being replaced with LEDs at some airports in threshold lights, taxiway edge lights, taxiway centerline lights, low intensity runway edge lights, windcone lights, beacons, and some obstruction lighting. Additionally, there are plans to replace incandescent lamps with LEDs in approach lighting systems.\u00a0 Pilots should be aware that LED lights cannot be sensed by infrared-based EFVSs. Further, the FAA does not currently collect or disseminate information about where LED lighting is installed.\n\nOther Vision Systems. Unlike an EFVS that meets the equipment requirements of 14\u2009CFR\u2009\u00a7\u00a091.176, a Synthetic Vision System (SVS) or Synthetic Vision Guidance System (SVGS) does not provide a real-time sensor image of the outside scene and also does not meet the equipment requirements for EFVS operations. A pilot cannot use a synthetic vision image on a head-up or a head-down display in lieu of natural vision to descend below DA/DH or MDA. An EFVS can, however, be integrated with an SVS, also known as a Combined Vision System (CVS). A CVS can be used to conduct EFVS operations if all of the requirements for an EFVS are satisfied and the SVS image does not interfere with the pilot's ability to see the external scene, to identify the required visual references, or to see the sensor image.\n\nAdditional Information. Operational criteria for EFVS can be found in Advisory Circular (AC) 90-106, Enhanced Flight Vision System Operations, and airworthiness criteria for EFVS can be found in AC\u200920-167, Airworthiness Approval of Enhanced Vision System, Synthetic Vision System, Combined Vision System, and Enhanced Flight Vision System Equipment."

                "section-content": "A visual approach is conducted on an IFR flight plan and authorizes a pilot to proceed visually and clear of clouds to the airport. The pilot must have either the airport or the preceding identified aircraft in sight. This approach must be authorized and controlled by the appropriate air traffic control facility. Reported weather at the airport must have a ceiling at or above 1,000 feet and visibility 3 miles or greater. ATC may authorize this type of approach when it will be operationally beneficial. Visual approaches are an IFR procedure conducted under IFR in visual meteorological conditions. Cloud clearance requirements of 14 CFR Section 91.155 are not applicable, unless required by operation specifications. When conducting visual approaches, pilots are encouraged to use other available navigational aids to assist in positive lateral and vertical alignment with the runway.\n\n\nOperating to an Airport Without Weather Reporting Service. ATC will advise the pilot when weather is not available at the destination airport. ATC may initiate a visual approach provided there is a reasonable assurance that weather at the airport is a ceiling at or above 1,000 feet and visibility 3 miles or greater (e.g., area weather reports, PIREPs, etc.).\n\nOperating to an Airport With an Operating Control Tower. Aircraft may be authorized to conduct a visual approach to one runway while other aircraft are conducting IFR or VFR approaches to another parallel, intersecting, or converging runway. ATC may authorize a visual approach after advising all aircraft involved that other aircraft are conducting operations to the other runway. This may be accomplished through use of the ATIS.\n\nWhen operating to parallel runways separated by less than 2,500 feet, ATC will ensure approved separation is provided unless the succeeding aircraft reports sighting the preceding aircraft to the adjacent parallel and visual separation is applied.\n\n\nWhen operating to parallel runways separated by at least 2,500 feet but less than 4,300 feet, ATC will ensure approved separation is provided until the aircraft are issued an approach clearance and one pilot has acknowledged receipt of a visual approach clearance, and the other pilot has acknowledged receipt of a visual or instrument approach clearance, and aircraft are established on a heading or established on a direct course to a fix or cleared on an RNAV/instrument approach procedure which will intercept the extended centerline of the runway at an angle not greater than 30 degrees.\n\nWhen operating to parallel runways separated by 4,300 feet or more, ATC will ensure approved separation is provided until one of the aircraft has been issued and the pilot has acknowledged receipt of the visual approach clearance, and each aircraft is assigned a heading, or established on a direct course to a fix, or cleared on an RNAV/instrument approach procedure which will allow the aircraft to intercept the extended centerline of the runway at an angle not greater than 30 degrees.\n\nNOTE-\nThe intent of the 30 degree intercept angle is to reduce the potential for overshoots of the final and to preclude side-by-side operations with one or both aircraft in a belly-up configuration during the turn-on.\n\nClearance for Visual Approach. At locations with an operating control tower, ATC will issue approach clearances that will include an assigned runway. At locations without an operating control tower or where a part-time tower is closed, ATC will issue a visual approach clearance to the airport only.\n\nSeparation Responsibilities. If the pilot has the airport in sight but cannot see the aircraft to be followed, ATC may clear the aircraft for a visual approach; however, ATC retains both separation and wake vortex separation responsibility. When visually following a preceding aircraft, acceptance of the visual approach clearance constitutes acceptance of pilot responsibility for maintaining a safe approach interval and adequate wake turbulence separation.\n\nA visual approach is not an IAP and therefore has no missed approach segment. If a go-around is necessary for any reason, aircraft operating at controlled airports will be issued an appropriate clearance or instruction by the tower to enter the traffic pattern for landing or proceed as otherwise instructed. In either case, the pilot is responsible to maintain terrain and obstruction avoidance until reaching an ATC assigned altitude if issued, and ATC will provide approved separation or visual separation from other IFR aircraft. At uncontrolled airports, aircraft are expected to remain clear of clouds and complete a landing as soon as possible. If a landing cannot be accomplished, the aircraft is expected to remain clear of clouds and contact ATC as soon as possible for further clearance. Separation from other IFR aircraft will be maintained under these circumstances.\n\nVisual approaches reduce pilot/controller workload and expedite traffic by shortening flight paths to the airport. It is the pilot's responsibility to advise ATC as soon as possible if a visual approach is not desired.\n\nAuthorization to conduct a visual approach is an IFR authorization and does not alter IFR flight plan cancellation responsibility.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-1-15, Canceling IFR Flight Plan.\n\n\nRadar service is automatically terminated, without advising the pilot, when the aircraft is instructed to change to advisory frequency."

The primary purpose of the Near Midair Collision (NMAC) Reporting Program is to provide information for use in enhancing the safety and efficiency of the National Airspace System. Data obtained from NMAC reports are used by the FAA to improve the quality of FAA services to users and to develop programs, policies, and procedures aimed at the reduction of NMAC occurrences. All NMAC reports are thoroughly investigated by Flight Standards Facilities in coordination with Air Traffic Facilities. Data from these investigations are transmitted to FAA Headquarters in Washington, DC, where they are compiled and analyzed, and where safety programs and recommendations are developed.\n\n\nDefinition. A near midair collision is defined as an incident associated with the operation of an aircraft in which a possibility of collision occurs as a result of proximity of less than 500 feet to another aircraft, or a report is received from a pilot or a flight crew member stating that a collision hazard existed between two or more aircraft.\n\nReporting Responsibility. It is the responsibility of the pilot and/or flight crew to determine whether a near midair collision did actually occur and, if so, to initiate a NMAC report. Be specific, as ATC will not interpret a casual remark to mean that a NMAC is being reported. The pilot should state \u201cI wish to report a near midair collision.\u201d\n\nWhere to File Reports. Pilots and/or flight crew members involved in NMAC occurrences are urged to report each incident immediately:\n\nBy radio or telephone to the nearest FAA ATC facility or FSS.\n\n\nIn writing, in lieu of the above, to the nearest Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).\n\nItems to be Reported.\n\nDate and time (UTC) of incident.\n\n\nLocation of incident and altitude.\n\nIdentification and type of reporting aircraft, aircrew destination, name and home base of pilot.\n\nIdentification and type of other aircraft, aircrew destination, name and home base of pilot.\n\nType of flight plans; station altimeter setting used.\n\nDetailed weather conditions at altitude or flight level.\n\nApproximate courses of both aircraft: indicate if one or both aircraft were climbing or descending.\n\nReported separation in distance at first sighting, proximity at closest point horizontally and vertically, and length of time in sight prior to evasive action.\n\nDegree of evasive action taken, if any (from both aircraft, if possible).\n\nInjuries, if any.\n\nInvestigation. The FSDO in whose area the incident occurred is responsible for the investigation and reporting of NMACs.\n\nExisting radar, communication, and weather data will be examined in the conduct of the investigation. When possible, all cockpit crew members will be interviewed regarding factors involving the NMAC incident. Air traffic controllers will be interviewed in cases where one or more of the involved aircraft was provided ATC service. Both flight and ATC procedures will be evaluated. When the investigation reveals a violation of an FAA regulation, enforcement action will be pursued."

These facilities normally operate in a frequency band of 190 to 535 kilohertz (kHz), according to ICAO Annex 10 the frequency range for NDBs is between 190 and 1750 kHz, and transmit a continuous carrier with either 400 or 1020\u2009hertz (Hz) modulation. All radio beacons except the compass locators transmit a continuous three-letter identification in code except during voice transmissions.\n\n\nWhen a radio beacon is used in conjunction with the Instrument Landing System markers, it is called a Compass Locator.\n\nVoice transmissions are made on radio beacons unless the letter \u201cW\u201d (without voice) is included in the class designator (HW).\n\nRadio beacons are subject to disturbances that may result in erroneous bearing information. Such disturbances result from such factors as lightning, precipitation static, etc. At night, radio beacons are vulnerable to interference from distant stations. Nearly all disturbances which affect the Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) bearing also affect the facility's identification. Noisy identification usually occurs when the ADF needle is erratic. Voice, music or erroneous identification may be heard when a steady false bearing is being displayed. Since ADF receivers do not have a \u201cflag\u201d to warn the pilot when erroneous bearing information is being displayed, the pilot should continuously monitor the NDB's identification."

                "section-content": "VORs operate within the 108.0 to 117.95 MHz frequency band and have a power output necessary to provide coverage within their assigned operational service volume. They are subject to line-of-sight restrictions, and the range varies proportionally to the altitude of the receiving equipment.\n\nNOTE-\nNormal service ranges for the various classes of VORs are given in Navigational Aid (NAVAID) Service Volumes, Paragraph 1-1-8.\n\n\nMost VORs are equipped for voice transmission on the VOR frequency. VORs without voice capability are indicated by the letter \u201cW\u201d (without voice) included in the class designator (VORW).\n\nThe only positive method of identifying a VOR is by its Morse Code identification or by the recorded automatic voice identification which is always indicated by use of the word \u201cVOR\u201d following the range's name. Reliance on determining the identification of an omnirange should never be placed on listening to voice transmissions by the Flight Service Station (FSS) (or approach control facility) involved. Many FSSs remotely operate several omniranges with different names. In some cases, none of the VORs have the name of the \u201cparent\u201d FSS. During periods of maintenance, the facility may radiate a T-E-S-T code (-\u2009\u25cf\u2009\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u2009-) or the code may be removed. Some VOR equipment decodes the identifier and displays it to the pilot for verification to\u2009charts, while other equipment simply displays the expected identifier from a database to aid in verification to the audio tones. You should be familiar with your equipment and use it appropriately.  If your equipment automatically decodes the identifier, it is not necessary to listen to the audio identification.\n\nVoice identification has been added to numerous VORs. The transmission consists of a voice announcement, \u201cAIRVILLE VOR\u201d alternating with the usual Morse Code identification.\n\nThe effectiveness of the VOR depends upon proper use and adjustment of both ground and airborne equipment.\n\nAccuracy. The accuracy of course alignment of the VOR is excellent, being generally plus or minus 1 degree.\n\n\nRoughness. On some VORs, minor course roughness may be observed, evidenced by course needle or brief flag alarm activity (some receivers are more susceptible to these irregularities than others). At a few stations, usually in mountainous terrain, the pilot may occasionally observe a brief course needle oscillation, similar to the indication of \u201capproaching station.\u201d Pilots flying over unfamiliar routes are cautioned to be on the alert for these vagaries, and in particular, to use the \u201cto/from\u201d indicator to determine positive station passage.\n\nCertain propeller revolutions per minute (RPM) settings or helicopter rotor speeds can cause the VOR Course Deviation Indicator to fluctuate as much as plus or minus six degrees. Slight changes to the RPM setting will normally smooth out this roughness. Pilots are urged to check for this modulation phenomenon prior to reporting a VOR station or aircraft equipment for unsatisfactory operation.\n\n\nThe VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON). As flight procedures and route structure based on VORs are gradually being replaced with Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) procedures, the FAA is removing selected VORs from service. PBN procedures are primarily enabled by GPS and its augmentation systems, collectively referred to as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Aircraft that carry DME/DME equipment can also use RNAV which provides a backup to continue flying PBN during a GNSS disruption. For those aircraft that do not carry DME/DME, the FAA is retaining a limited network of VORs, called the VOR MON, to provide a basic conventional navigation service for operators to use if GNSS becomes unavailable. During a GNSS disruption, the MON will enable aircraft to navigate through the affected area or to a safe landing at a MON airport without reliance on GNSS. Navigation using the MON will not be as efficient as the new PBN route structure, but use of the MON will provide nearly continuous VOR signal coverage at 5,000 feet AGL across the NAS, outside of the Western U.S. Mountainous Area (WUSMA).\n\nNOTE-\nThere is no plan to change the NAVAID and route structure in the WUSMA.\nThe VOR MON has been retained principally for IFR aircraft that are not equipped with DME/DME avionics. However, VFR aircraft may use the MON as desired. Aircraft equipped with DME/DME navigation systems would, in most cases, use DME/DME to continue flight using RNAV to their destination. However, these aircraft may, of course, use the MON.\n\nDistance to a MON airport. The VOR MON will ensure that regardless of an aircraft's position in the contiguous United States (CONUS), a MON airport (equipped with legacy ILS or VOR approaches) \u00a0will be within 100 nautical miles. These airports are referred to as \u201cMON airports\u201d and will have an ILS approach or a VOR approach if an ILS is not available. VORs to support these approaches will be retained in the VOR MON. MON airports are charted on low-altitude en route charts and are contained in the Chart Supplement U.S. and other appropriate publications.\n\nNOTE-\nAny suitable airport can be used to land in the event of a VOR outage. For example, an airport with a DME-required ILS approach may be available and could be used by aircraft that are equipped with DME. The intent of the MON airport is to provide an approach that can be used by aircraft without ADF or DME when radar may not be available.\n\n\nNavigating to an airport. The VOR MON will retain sufficient VORs and increase VOR service volume to ensure that pilots will have nearly continuous signal reception of a VOR when flying at 5,000 feet AGL. A key concept of the MON is to ensure that an aircraft will always be within 100 NM of an airport with an instrument approach that is not dependent on GPS. (See paragraph 1-1-8.) If the pilot encounters a GPS outage, the pilot will be able to proceed via VOR-to-VOR navigation at 5,000\u2009feet AGL through the GPS outage area or to a safe landing at a MON airport or another suitable airport, as appropriate. Nearly all VORs inside of the WUSMA and outside the CONUS are being retained. In these areas, pilots use the existing (Victor and Jet) route structure and VORs to proceed through a GPS outage or to a landing.\n\nUsing the VOR MON.\n\nIn the case of a planned GPS outage (for example, one that is in a published NOTAM), pilots may plan to fly through the outage using the MON as appropriate and as cleared by ATC. Similarly, aircraft not equipped with GPS may plan to fly and land using the MON, as appropriate and as cleared by ATC.\n\nNOTE-\nIn many cases, flying using the MON may involve a more circuitous route than flying GPS-enabled RNAV.\n\n\nIn the case of an unscheduled GPS outage, pilots and ATC will need to coordinate the best outcome for all aircraft. It is possible that a GPS outage could be disruptive, causing high workload and demand for ATC service. Generally, the VOR MON concept will enable pilots to navigate through the GPS outage or land at a MON airport or at another airport that may have an appropriate approach or may be in visual conditions.\n\nThe VOR MON is a reversionary service provided by the FAA for use by aircraft that are unable to continue RNAV during a GPS disruption. The FAA has not mandated that preflight or inflight planning include provisions for GPS- or WAAS-equipped aircraft to carry sufficient fuel to proceed to a MON airport in case of an unforeseen GPS outage. Specifically, flying to a MON airport as a filed alternate will not be explicitly required. Of course, consideration for the possibility of a GPS outage is prudent during flight planning as is maintaining proficiency with VOR navigation.\n\n\nAlso, in case of a GPS outage, pilots may coordinate with ATC and elect to continue through the outage or land. The VOR MON is designed to ensure that an aircraft is within 100 NM of an airport, but pilots may decide to proceed to any appropriate airport where a landing can be made. WAAS users flying under Part 91 are not required to carry VOR avionics. These users do not have the ability or requirement to use the VOR MON. Prudent flight planning, by these WAAS-only aircraft, should consider the possibility of a GPS outage.\n\nNOTE-\nThe FAA recognizes that non-GPS-based approaches will be reduced when VORs are eliminated, and that most airports with an instrument approach may only have GPS- or WAAS-based approaches. Pilots flying GPS- or WAAS-equipped aircraft that also have VOR/ILS avionics should be diligent to maintain proficiency in VOR and ILS approaches in the event of a GPS outage."

                "section-content": "The FAA VOR test facility (VOT) transmits a test signal which provides users a convenient means to determine the operational status and accuracy of a VOR receiver while on the ground where a VOT is located. The airborne use of VOT is permitted; however, its use is strictly limited to those areas/altitudes specifically authorized in the Chart Supplement or appropriate supplement.\n\n\nTo use the VOT service, tune in the VOT frequency on your VOR receiver. With the Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) centered, the omni-bearing selector should read 0 degrees with the to/from indication showing \u201cfrom\u201d or the omni-bearing selector should read 180 degrees with the to/from indication showing \u201cto.\u201d Should the VOR receiver operate an RMI (Radio Magnetic Indicator), it will indicate 180 degrees on any omni-bearing selector (OBS) setting. Two means of identification are used. One is a series of dots and the other is a continuous tone. Information concerning an individual test signal can be obtained from the local FSS.\n\nPeriodic VOR receiver calibration is most important. If a receiver's Automatic Gain Control or modulation circuit deteriorates, it is possible for it to display acceptable accuracy and sensitivity close into the VOR or VOT and display out-of-tolerance readings when located at greater distances where weaker signal areas exist. The likelihood of this deterioration varies between receivers, and is generally considered a function of time. The best assurance of having an accurate receiver is periodic calibration. Yearly intervals are recommended at which time an authorized repair facility should recalibrate the receiver to the manufacturer's specifications.\n\nFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Section\u200991.171) provides for certain VOR equipment accuracy checks prior to flight under instrument flight rules. To comply with this requirement and to ensure satisfactory operation of the airborne system, the FAA has provided pilots with the following means of checking VOR receiver accuracy:\n\nVOT or a radiated test signal from an appropriately rated radio repair station.\n\n\nCertified airborne checkpoints and airways.\n\nCertified checkpoints on the airport surface.\n\nIf an airborne checkpoint is not available, select an established VOR airway. Select a prominent ground point, preferably more than 20 NM from the VOR ground facility and maneuver the aircraft directly over the point at a reasonably low altitude above terrain and obstructions.\n\nA radiated VOT from an appropriately rated radio repair station serves the same purpose as an FAA VOR signal and the check is made in much the same manner as a VOT with the following differences:\n\nThe frequency normally approved by the Federal Communications Commission is 108.0\u2009MHz.\n\n\nRepair stations are not permitted to radiate the VOR test signal continuously; consequently, the owner or operator must make arrangements with the repair station to have the test signal transmitted. This service is not provided by all radio repair stations. The aircraft owner or operator must determine which repair station in the local area provides this service. A representative of the repair station must make an entry into the aircraft logbook or other permanent record certifying to the radial accuracy and the date of transmission. The owner, operator or representative of the repair station may accomplish the necessary checks in the aircraft and make a logbook entry stating the results. It is necessary to verify which test radial is being transmitted and whether you should get a \u201cto\u201d or \u201cfrom\u201d indication.\n\nAirborne and ground check points consist of certified radials that should be received at specific points on the airport surface or over specific landmarks while airborne in the immediate vicinity of the airport.\n\nShould an error in excess of plus or minus 4\u2009degrees be indicated through use of a ground check, or plus or minus 6 degrees using the airborne check, Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight must not be attempted without first correcting the source of the error.\n\nCAUTION-\n \nNo correction other than the correction card figures supplied by the manufacturer should be applied in making these VOR receiver checks.\n\n\nLocations of airborne check points, ground check points and VOTs are published in the Chart Supplement.\n\nIf a dual system VOR (units independent of each other except for the antenna) is installed in the aircraft, one system may be checked against the other. Turn both systems to the same VOR ground facility and note the indicated bearing to that station. The maximum permissible variations between the two indicated bearings is 4 degrees."

A new navigational system, TACAN, was therefore developed by the military and naval forces to more readily lend itself to military and naval requirements. As a result, the FAA has integrated TACAN facilities with the civil VOR/DME program. Although the theoretical, or technical principles of operation of TACAN equipment are quite different from those of VOR/DME facilities, the end result, as far as the navigating pilot is concerned, is the same. These integrated facilities are called VORTACs.\n\n\nTACAN ground equipment consists of either a fixed or mobile transmitting unit. The airborne unit in conjunction with the ground unit reduces the transmitted signal to a visual presentation of both azimuth and distance information. TACAN is a pulse system and operates in the Ultrahigh Frequency (UHF) band of frequencies. Its use requires TACAN airborne equipment and does not operate through conventional VOR equipment."

Both components of a VORTAC are envisioned as operating simultaneously and providing the three services at all times.\n\n\nTransmitted signals of VOR and TACAN are each identified by three-letter code transmission and are interlocked so that pilots using VOR azimuth with TACAN distance can be assured that both signals being received are definitely from the same ground station.

The ground station (transponder) then transmits paired pulses back to the aircraft at the same pulse spacing but on a different frequency. The time required for the round trip of this signal exchange is measured in the airborne DME unit and is translated into distance (nautical miles) from the aircraft to the ground station.\n\n\nOperating on the line-of-sight principle, DME furnishes distance information with a very high degree of accuracy. Reliable signals may be received at distances up to 199 NM at line-of-sight altitude with an accuracy of better than 1/2 mile or 3 percent of the distance, whichever is greater. Distance information received from DME equipment is SLANT RANGE distance and not actual horizontal distance.\n\nOperating frequency range of a DME according to ICAO Annex 10 is from 960 MHz to 1215 MHz. Aircraft equipped with TACAN equipment will receive distance information from a VORTAC automatically, while aircraft equipped with VOR must have a separate DME airborne unit.\n\nVOR/DME, VORTAC, Instrument Landing System (ILS)/DME, and localizer (LOC)/DME navigation facilities established by the FAA provide course and distance information from collocated components under a frequency pairing plan. Aircraft receiving equipment which provides for automatic DME selection assures reception of azimuth and distance information from a common source when designated VOR/DME, VORTAC, ILS/DME, and LOC/DME are selected.\n\nDue to the limited number of available frequencies, assignment of paired frequencies is required for certain military noncollocated VOR and TACAN facilities which serve the same area but which may be separated by distances up to a few miles.\n\nVOR/DME, VORTAC, ILS/DME, and LOC/DME facilities are identified by synchronized identifications which are transmitted on a time share basis. The VOR or localizer portion of the facility is identified by a coded tone modulated at 1020 Hz or a combination of code and voice. The TACAN or DME is identified by a coded tone modulated at 1350\u2009Hz. The DME or TACAN coded identification is transmitted one time for each three or four times that the VOR or localizer coded identification is transmitted. When either the VOR or the DME is inoperative, it is important to recognize which identifier is retained for the operative facility. A single coded identification with a repetition interval of approximately 30 seconds indicates that the DME is operative.\n\nAircraft equipment which provides for automatic DME selection assures reception of azimuth and distance information from a common source when designated VOR/DME, VORTAC and ILS/DME navigation facilities are selected. Pilots are cautioned to disregard any distance displays from automatically selected DME equipment when VOR or ILS facilities, which do not have the DME feature installed, are being used for position determination."

The SSV is a three-dimensional volume within which the FAA ensures that a signal can be received with adequate signal strength and course quality, and is free from interference from other NAVAIDs on similar frequencies (e.g., co-channel or adjacent-channel interference). However, the SSV signal protection does not include potential blockage from terrain or obstructions. The SSV is principally intended for off-route navigation, such as proceeding direct to or from a VOR when not on a published instrument procedure or route. Navigation on published instrument procedures (e.g., approaches or departures) or routes (e.g., Victor routes) may use NAVAIDs outside of the SSV, when Extended Service Volume (ESV) is approved, since adequate signal strength, course quality, and freedom from interference are verified by the FAA prior to the publishing of the instrument procedure or route.\n\nNOTE-\nA conical area directly above the NAVAID is generally not usable for navigation.\n\n\nA NAVAID will have service volume restrictions if it does not conform to signal strength and course quality standards throughout the published SSV. Service volume restrictions are first published in Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs) and then with the alphabetical listing of the NAVAIDs in the Chart Supplement. Service volume restrictions do not generally apply to published instrument procedures or routes unless published in NOTAMs for the affected instrument procedure or route.\n\nVOR/DME/TACAN Standard Service Volumes (SSV).\n\nThe three original SSVs are shown in FIG 1-1-1 and are designated with three classes of NAVAIDs: Terminal (T), Low (L), and High (H). The usable distance of the NAVAID depends on the altitude Above the Transmitter Height (ATH) for each class. The lower edge of the usable distance when below 1,000 feet ATH is shown in FIG 1-1-2 for Terminal NAVAIDs and in FIG 1-1-3 for Low and High NAVAIDs.\nFIG 1-1-1Original Standard Service Volumes\nFIG 1-1-2Lower Edge of the Terminal Service Volume (in altitude ATH)\nFIG 1-1-3Lower Edge of Low and High Service Volumes (in altitude ATH)\n\n\nWith the progression of navigation capabilities to Performance Based Navigation (PBN), additional capabilities for off-route navigation are necessary. For example, the VOR MON (See paragraph 1-1-3 f.) requires the use of VORs at 5,000 feet AGL, which is beyond the original SSV ranges. Additionally, PBN procedures using DME require extended ranges. As a result, the FAA created four additional SSVs. Two of the new SSVs are associated with VORs: VOR Low (VL) and VOR High (VH), as shown in FIG 1-1-4. The other two new SSVs are associated with DME: DME Low (DL) and DME High (DH), as shown in FIG 1-1-5. The SSV at altitudes below 1,000 feet for the VL and VH are the same as FIG 1-1-3. The SSVs at altitudes below 12,900 feet for the DL and DH SSVs correspond to a conservative estimate of the DME radio line of sight (RLOS) coverage at each altitude (not including possible terrain blockage).\nFIG 1-1-4New VOR Service Volumes\nFIG 1-1-5New DME Service Volumes\n\nNOTE-\nIn the past, NAVAIDs at one location typically all had the same SSV. For example, a VORTAC typically had a High (H) SSV for the VOR, the TACAN azimuth, and the TACAN DME, or a Low (L) or Terminal (T) SSV for all three. A VOR/DME typically had a High (H), Low (L), or Terminal (T) for both the VOR and the DME. A common SSV may no longer be the case at all locations. A VOR/DME, for example, could have an SSV of VL for the VOR and DH for the DME, or other combinations.The TACAN azimuth will only be classified as T, L, or H.\n\nTBL 1-1-1 is a tabular summary of the VOR, DME, and TACAN NAVAID SSVs, not including altitudes below 1,000 feet ATH for VOR and TACAN Azimuth, and not including ranges for altitudes below 12,900 feet for TACAN and DME.\nTBL 1-1-1VOR/DME/TACAN Standard Service Volumes\n\n\n\nSSV Designator\n\n\nAltitude and Range Boundaries\n\n\n\n\nT (Terminal)\n\n\nFrom 1,000 feet ATH up to and including 12,000 feet ATH at radial distances out to 25 NM.\n\n\n\n\nL (Low Altitude)\n\n\nFrom 1,000 feet ATH up to and including 18,000 feet ATH at radial distances out to 40 NM.\n\n\n\n\nH (High Altitude)\n\n\nFrom 1,000 feet ATH up to and including 14,500 feet ATH at radial distances out to 40 NM.

                "section-content": "General\n\nThe ILS is designed to provide an approach path for exact alignment and descent of an aircraft on final approach to a runway.\n\n\nThe basic components of an ILS are the localizer, glide slope, and Outer Marker (OM) and, when installed for use with Category II or Category III instrument approach procedures, an Inner Marker (IM).\n\nThe system may be divided functionally into three parts:\n\nGuidance information: localizer, glide slope.\n\n\nRange information: marker beacon, DME.\n\nVisual information: approach lights, touchdown and centerline lights, runway lights.\n\nThe following means may be used to substitute for the OM:\n\nCompass locator; or\n\n\nPrecision Approach Radar (PAR); or\n\nAirport Surveillance Radar (ASR); or\n\nDistance Measuring Equipment (DME), Very High Frequency Omni-directional Range (VOR), or Nondirectional beacon fixes authorized in the Standard Instrument Approach Procedure; or\n\nVery High Frequency Omni-directional Radio Range (VOR); or\n\nNondirectional beacon fixes authorized in the Standard Instrument Approach Procedure; or\n\nA suitable RNAV system with Global Positioning System (GPS), capable of fix identification on a Standard Instrument Approach Procedure.\n\nWhere a complete ILS system is installed on each end of a runway; (i.e., the approach end of Runway 4 and the approach end of Runway 22) the ILS systems are not in service simultaneously.\n\n\nLocalizer\n\nThe localizer transmitter operates on one of 40 ILS channels within the frequency range of 108.10\u2009to 111.95 MHz. Signals provide the pilot with course guidance to the runway centerline.\n\n\nThe approach course of the localizer is called the front course and is used with other functional parts, e.g., glide slope, marker beacons, etc. The localizer signal is transmitted at the far end of the runway. It is adjusted for a course width of (full scale fly-left to a full scale fly-right) of 700 feet at the runway threshold.\n\nThe course line along the extended centerline of a runway, in the opposite direction to the front course is called the back course.\n\nCAUTION-\n \nUnless the aircraft's ILS equipment includes reverse sensing capability, when flying inbound on the back course it is necessary to steer the aircraft in the direction opposite the needle deflection when making corrections from off-course to on-course. This \u201cflying away from the needle\u201d is also required when flying outbound on the front course of the localizer. Do not use back course signals for approach unless a back course approach procedure is published for that particular runway and the approach is authorized by ATC.\n\nIdentification is in International Morse Code and consists of a three-letter identifier preceded by the letter I (\u25cf\u25cf) transmitted on the localizer frequency.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nI-DIA\nThe localizer provides course guidance throughout the descent path to the runway threshold from a distance of 18 NM from the antenna between an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest terrain along the course line and 4,500 feet above the elevation of the antenna site. Proper off-course indications are provided throughout the following angular areas of the operational service volume:\n\nTo 10 degrees either side of the course along a radius of 18 NM from the antenna; and\n\n\nFrom 10 to 35 degrees either side of the course along a radius of 10 NM. (See FIG 1-1-6.)\nFIG 1-1-6Limits of Localizer Coverage\n\nUnreliable signals may be received outside of these areas. ATC may clear aircraft on procedures beyond the service volume when the controller initiates the action or when the pilot requests, and radar monitoring is provided.\n\nThe areas described in paragraph 1-1-9 b5 and depicted in FIG 1-1-6 represent a Standard Service Volume (SSV) localizer. All charted procedures with localizer coverage beyond the 18\u2009NM SSV have been through the approval process for Expanded Service Volume (ESV), and have been validated by flight inspection. (See FIG 1-1-7.)\nFIG 1-1-7ILS Expanded Service Volume\n\nLocalizer Type Directional Aid (LDA)\n\nThe LDA is of comparable use and accuracy to a localizer but is not part of a complete ILS. The LDA course usually provides a more precise approach course than the similar Simplified Directional Facility (SDF) installation, which may have a course width of 6 or 12 degrees.\n\n\nThe LDA is not aligned with the runway. Straight-in minimums may be published where alignment does not exceed 30 degrees between the course and runway. Circling minimums only are published where this alignment exceeds 30 degrees.\n\nA very limited number of LDA approaches also incorporate a glideslope. These are annotated in the plan view of the instrument approach chart with a note, \u201cLDA/Glideslope.\u201d These procedures fall under a newly defined category of approaches called Approach with Vertical Guidance (APV) described in paragraph 5-4-5, Instrument Approach Procedure Charts, subparagraph a7(b), Approach with Vertical Guidance (APV). LDA minima for with and without glideslope is provided and annotated on the minima lines of the approach chart as S-LDA/GS and S-LDA. Because the final approach course is not aligned with the runway centerline, additional maneuvering will be required compared to an ILS approach.\n\nGlide Slope/Glide Path\n\nThe UHF glide slope transmitter, operating on one of the 40 ILS channels within the frequency range 329.15 MHz, to 335.00 MHz radiates its signals in the direction of the localizer front course. The term \u201cglide path\u201d means that portion of the glide slope that intersects the localizer.\n\nCAUTION-\n \nFalse glide slope signals may exist in the area of the localizer back course approach which can cause the glide slope flag alarm to disappear and present unreliable glide slope information. Disregard all glide slope signal indications when making a localizer back course approach unless a glide slope is specified on the approach and landing chart.\n\n\nThe glide slope transmitter is located between 750 feet and 1,250 feet from the approach end of the runway (down the runway) and offset 250 to 650 feet from the runway centerline. It transmits a glide path beam 1.4 degrees wide (vertically). The signal provides descent information for navigation down to the lowest authorized decision height (DH) specified in the approved ILS approach procedure. The glidepath may not be suitable for navigation below the lowest authorized DH and any reference to glidepath indications below that height must be supplemented by visual reference to the runway environment. Glidepaths with no published DH are usable to runway threshold.\n\nThe glide path projection angle is normally adjusted to 3 degrees above horizontal so that it intersects the MM at about 200 feet and the OM at about 1,400 feet above the runway elevation. The glide slope is normally usable to the distance of 10\u2009NM. However, at some locations, the glide slope has been certified for an extended service volume which exceeds 10 NM.\n\nPilots must be alert when approaching the glidepath interception. False courses and reverse sensing will occur at angles considerably greater than the published path.\n\nMake every effort to remain on the indicated glide path.\n\nCAUTION-\n \nAvoid flying below the glide path to assure obstacle/terrain clearance is maintained.\n\nThe published glide slope threshold crossing height (TCH) DOES NOT represent the height of the actual glide path on-course indication above the runway threshold. It is used as a reference for planning purposes which represents the height above the runway threshold that an aircraft's glide slope antenna should be, if that aircraft remains on a trajectory formed by the four-mile-to-middle marker glidepath segment.\n\nPilots must be aware of the vertical height between the aircraft's glide slope antenna and the main gear in the landing configuration and, at the DH, plan to adjust the descent angle accordingly if the published TCH indicates the wheel crossing height over the runway threshold may not be satisfactory. Tests indicate a comfortable wheel crossing height is approximately 20 to 30 feet, depending on the type of aircraft.\n\nNOTE-\nThe TCH for a runway is established based on several factors including the largest aircraft category that normally uses the runway, how airport layout affects the glide slope antenna placement, and terrain. A higher than optimum TCH, with the same glide path angle, may cause the aircraft to touch down further from the threshold if the trajectory of the approach is maintained until the flare.  Pilots should consider the effect of a high TCH on the runway available for stopping the aircraft.\n\nDistance Measuring Equipment (DME)\n\nWhen installed with the ILS and specified in the approach procedure, DME may be used:\n\nIn lieu of the OM;\n\n\nAs a back course (BC) final approach fix (FAF); and\n\nTo establish other fixes on the localizer course.\n\n\nIn some cases, DME from a separate facility may be used within Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) limitations:\n\nTo provide ARC initial approach segments;\n\n\nAs a FAF for BC approaches; and\n\nAs a substitute for the OM.\n\nMarker Beacon\n\nILS marker beacons have a rated power output of 3 watts or less and an antenna array designed to produce an elliptical pattern with dimensions, at 1,000 feet above the antenna, of approximately 2,400\u2009feet in width and 4,200 feet in length. Airborne marker beacon receivers with a selective sensitivity feature should always be operated in the \u201clow\u201d sensitivity position for proper reception of ILS marker beacons.\n\n\nILS systems may have an associated OM. An MM is no longer required. Locations with a Category II ILS also have an Inner Marker (IM). Due to advances in both ground navigation equipment and airborne avionics, as well as the numerous means that may be used as a substitute for a marker beacon, the current requirements for the use of marker beacons are:\n\nAn OM or suitable substitute identifies the Final Approach Fix (FAF) for nonprecision approach (NPA) operations (for example, localizer only); and\n\n\nThe MM indicates a position approximately 3,500 feet from the landing threshold. This is also the position where an aircraft on the glide path will be at an altitude of approximately 200 feet above the elevation of the touchdown zone. A MM is no longer operationally required. There are some MMs still in use, but there are no MMs being installed at new ILS sites by the FAA; and\n\nAn IM, where installed, indicates the point at which an aircraft is at decision height on the glide path during a Category II ILS approach. An IM is only required for CAT II operations that do not have a published radio altitude (RA) minimum.\nTBL 1-1-3Marker Passage Indications\n\n\n\nMarker\n\n\nCode\n\n\nLight\n\n\n\n\nOM\n\n\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\n\nBLUE\n\n\n\n\nMM\n\n\n\u25cf  \u2212 \u25cf \u2212\n\n\nAMBER\n\n\n\n\nIM\n\n\n\u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf\n\n\nWHITE\n\n\n\n\nBC\n\n\n\u25cf \u25cf  \u25cf \u25cf\n\n\nWHITE\n\n\n\nA back course marker normally indicates the ILS back course final approach fix where approach descent is commenced.\n\nCompass Locator\n\nCompass locator transmitters are often situated at the MM and OM sites. The transmitters have a power of less than 25 watts, a range of at least 15\u2009miles and operate between 190 and 535 kHz. At some locations, higher powered radio beacons, up to 400 watts, are used as OM compass locators.\n\n\nCompass locators transmit two letter identification groups. The outer locator transmits the first two letters of the localizer identification group, and the middle locator transmits the last two letters of the localizer identification group.\n\nILS Frequency (See TBL 1-1-4.)\nTBL 1-1-4Frequency Pairs Allocated for ILS\n\n\n\nLocalizer MHz\n\n\nGlide Slope\n\n\n\n\n108.10\n\n\n334.70\n\n\n\n\n108.15\n\n\n334.55\n\n\n\n\n108.3\n\n\n334.10\n\n\n\n\n108.35\n\n\n333.95\n\n\n\n\n108.5\n\n\n329.90\n\n\n\n\n108.55\n\n\n329.75\n\n\n\n\n108.7\n\n\n330.50\n\n\n\n\n108.75\n\n\n330.35\n\n\n\n\n108.9\n\n\n329.30\n\n\n\n\n108.95\n\n\n329.15\n\n\n\n\n109.1\n\n\n331.40\n\n\n\n\n109.15\n\n\n331.25\n\n\n\n\n109.3\n\n\n332.00\n\n\n\n\n109.35\n\n\n331.85\n\n\n\n\n109.50\n\n\n332.60\n\n\n\n\n109.55\n\n\n332.45\n\n\n\n\n109.70\n\n\n333.20\n\n\n\n\n109.75\n\n\n333.05\n\n\n\n\n109.90\n\n\n333.80\n\n\n\n\n109.95\n\n\n333.65\n\n\n\n\n110.1\n\n\n334.40\n\n\n\n\n110.15\n\n\n334.25\n\n\n\n\n110.3\n\n\n335.00\n\n\n\n\n110.35\n\n\n334.85\n\n\n\n\n110.5\n\n\n329.60\n\n\n\n\n110.55\n\n\n329.45\n\n\n\n\n110.70\n\n\n330.20\n\n\n\n\n110.75\n\n\n330.05\n\n\n\n\n110.90\n\n\n330.80\n\n\n\n\n110.95\n\n\n330.65\n\n\n\n\n111.10\n\n\n331.70\n\n\n\n\n111.15\n\n\n331.55\n\n\n\n\n111.30\n\n\n332.30\n\n\n\n\n111.35\n\n\n332.15\n\n\n\n\n111.50\n\n\n332.9\n\n\n\n\n111.55\n\n\n332.75\n\n\n\n\n111.70\n\n\n333.5\n\n\n\n\n111.75\n\n\n333.35\n\n\n\n\n111.90\n\n\n331.1\n\n\n\n\n111.95\n\n\n330.95\n\n\n\nILS Minimums\n\nThe lowest authorized ILS minimums, with all required ground and airborne systems components operative, are:\n\nCategory I. Decision Height (DH) 200\u2009feet and Runway Visual Range (RVR) 2,400 feet (with touchdown zone and centerline lighting, RVR 1,800 feet), or (with Autopilot or FD or HUD, RVR 1,800 feet);\n\n\nSpecial Authorization Category I. DH\u2009150 feet and Runway Visual Range (RVR) 1,400 feet, HUD to DH;\n\nCategory II. DH 100 feet and RVR 1,200 feet (with autoland or HUD to touchdown and noted on authorization, RVR 1,000 feet);\n\nSpecial Authorization Category II with Reduced Lighting. DH 100 feet and RVR 1,200 feet with autoland or HUD to touchdown and noted on authorization (touchdown zone, centerline lighting, and ALSF-2 are not required);\n\nCategory IIIa. No DH or DH below 100 feet and RVR not less than 700 feet;\n\nCategory IIIb. No DH or DH below 50 feet and RVR less than 700 feet but not less than 150 feet; and\n\nCategory IIIc. No DH and no RVR limitation.\n\nNOTE-\nSpecial authorization and equipment required for Categories II and III.\n\n\nInoperative ILS Components\n\nInoperative localizer. When the localizer fails, an ILS approach is not authorized.\n\n\nInoperative glide slope. When the glide slope fails, the ILS reverts to a non-precision localizer approach.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nSee the inoperative component table in the U.S. Government Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP), for adjustments to minimums due to inoperative airborne or ground system equipment.\n\n\nILS Course and Glideslope Distortion\n\nAll pilots should be aware that ILS installations are subject to signal interference by surface vehicles and aircraft (either on the ground or airborne). ILS CRITICAL AREAS are established near each localizer and glide slope antenna. Pilots should be aware of the level of critical area protection they can expect in various weather conditions and understand that signal disturbances may occur as a result of normal airport operations irrespective of the official weather observation.\n\n\nATC is not always required to issue control instructions to avoid interfering operations within ILS critical areas at controlled airports during the hours the Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) is in operation. ATC responsibilities vary depending on the official weather observation and are described as follows:\n\nWeather Conditions. Official weather observation indicates a ceiling of 800 feet or higher and visibility 2 miles or greater, no localizer or glideslope critical area protection is provided by ATC unless specifically requested by the flight crew.\n\n\nWeather Conditions. Official weather observation indicates a ceiling of less than 800 feet or visibility less than 2 miles.\n\nHolding. Aircraft holding below 5,000 feet between the outer marker and the airport may cause localizer signal variations for aircraft conducting the ILS approach. Accordingly, such holding will not be authorized by ATC.\n\n\nLocalizer Critical Area. When an arriving aircraft is inside the outer marker (OM) or the fix used in lieu of the OM, vehicles and aircraft will not be authorized in or over the precision approach  critical area except:\n\nA preceding arriving aircraft on the same or another runway may pass over or through the localizer critical area, and;\n\n\nA preceding departing aircraft or missed approach on the same or another runway may pass through or over the localizer critical area.\n\nGlide Slope Critical Area. ATC will not authorize vehicles or aircraft operations in or over the glideslope critical area when an arriving aircraft is inside the outer marker (OM), or the fix used in lieu of the OM, unless the arriving aircraft has reported the runway in sight and is circling or side\u2010stepping to land on another runway.\n\nWeather Conditions. Official weather observation indicates a ceiling less than 200 feet or runway visual range (RVR) less than 2000 feet.\n\nLocalizer Critical Area. In addition to the critical area protection described in 1-1-9k2(b) above, when an arriving aircraft is inside the middle marker (MM), or in the absence of a MM, \u00bd mile final, ATC will not authorize:\n\nA preceding arriving aircraft on the same or another runway to pass over or through the localizer critical area, or;\n\n\nA preceding departing aircraft or missed approach on the same or another runway to pass through or over the localizer critical area.\n\n\nIn order to ensure that pilot and controller expectations match with respect to critical area protection for a given approach and landing operation, a flight crew should advise the tower any time it intends to conduct any autoland operation or use an SA CAT I, any CAT II, or any CAT III line of minima anytime the official weather observation is at or above a ceiling of 800 feet and 2 miles visibility.  If ATC is unable to protect the critical area, they will advise the flight crew.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nDenver Tower, United 1153, Request Autoland (runway) ATC replies with:\nUnited 1153, Denver Tower, Roger, Critical Areas not protected.\nPilots are cautioned that even when the critical areas are considered to be protected, unless the official weather observation including controller observations indicates a ceiling less than 200 feet or RVR less than 2000 feet, ATC may still authorize a preceding arriving, departing, or missed approach aircraft to pass through or over the localizer critical area and that this may cause signal disturbances that could result in an undesired aircraft state during the final stages of the approach, landing, and rollout.\n\nPilots are cautioned that vehicular traffic not subject to ATC may cause momentary deviation to ILS course or glide slope signals. Also, critical areas are not protected at uncontrolled airports or at airports with an operating control tower when weather or visibility conditions are above those requiring protective measures. Aircraft conducting coupled or autoland operations should be especially alert in monitoring automatic flight control systems and be prepared to intervene as necessary. (See FIG 1-1-8.)\n\nNOTE-\nUnless otherwise coordinated through Flight Standards, ILS signals to Category I runways are not flight inspected below the point that is 100 feet less than the decision altitude (DA). Guidance signal anomalies may be encountered below this altitude."

A clear understanding of the ILS localizer and the additional factors listed below completely describe the operational characteristics and use of the SDF.\n\n\nThe SDF transmits signals within the range of 108.10 to 111.95 MHz.\n\nThe approach techniques and procedures used in an SDF instrument approach are essentially the same as those employed in executing a standard localizer approach except the SDF course may not be aligned with the runway and the course may be wider, resulting in less precision.\n\nUsable off-course indications are limited to 35\u2009degrees either side of the course centerline. Instrument indications received beyond 35 degrees should be disregarded.\n\nThe SDF antenna may be offset from the runway centerline. Because of this, the angle of convergence between the final approach course and the runway bearing should be determined by reference to the instrument approach procedure chart. This angle is generally not more than 3 degrees. However, it should be noted that inasmuch as the approach course originates at the antenna site, an approach which is continued beyond the runway threshold will lead the aircraft to the SDF offset position rather than along the runway centerline.\n\nThe SDF signal is fixed at either 6 degrees or 12\u2009degrees as necessary to provide maximum flyability and optimum course quality.\n\nIdentification consists of a three-letter identifier transmitted in Morse Code on the SDF frequency. The appropriate instrument approach chart will indicate the identifier used at a particular airport.\nFIG 1-1-8FAA Instrument Landing Systems"

                "section-content": "Users of the National Airspace System (NAS) can render valuable assistance in the early correction of NAVAID malfunctions or GNSS problems and are encouraged to report their observations of undesirable avionics performance. Although NAVAIDs are monitored by electronic detectors, adverse effects of electronic interference, new obstructions, or changes in terrain near the NAVAID can exist without detection by the ground monitors. Some of the characteristics of malfunction or deteriorating performance which should be reported are: erratic course or bearing indications; intermittent, or full, flag alarm; garbled, missing or obviously improper coded identification; poor quality communications reception; or, in the case of frequency interference, an audible hum or tone accompanying radio communications or NAVAID identification. GNSS problems are often characterized by navigation degradation or service loss indications. For instance, pilots conducting operations in areas where there is GNSS interference may be unable to use GPS for navigation, and ADS-B may be unavailable for surveillance. Radio frequency interference may affect both navigation for the pilot and surveillance by the air traffic controller. Depending on the equipment and integration, either an advisory light or message may alert the pilot. Air traffic controllers monitoring ADS-B reports may stop receiving ADS-B position messages and associated aircraft tracks.\n\n\nMalfunctioning, faulty, inappropriately installed, operated, or modified GPS re-radiator systems, intended to be used for aircraft maintenance activities, have resulted in unintentional disruption of aviation GPS receivers. This type of disruption could result in unflagged, erroneous position-information output to primary flight displays/indicators and to other aircraft and air traffic control systems. Since Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is only partially effective against this type of disruption (effectively a \u201csignal spoofing\u201d), the pilot may not be aware of any erroneous navigation indications; ATC may be the only means available to identify these disruptions and detect unexpected aircraft positions while monitoring aircraft for IFR separation.\n\nPilots encountering navigation error events should transition to another source of navigation and request amended clearances from ATC as necessary.\n\nPilots are encouraged to submit detailed reports of NAVAID or GPS anomaly as soon as practical. Pilot reports of navigation error events should contain the following information:\n\nDate and time the anomaly was observed, and NAVAID ID (or GPS).\n\n\nLocation of the aircraft at the time the anomaly started and ended (e.g., latitude/longitude or bearing/distance from a reference point),\n\nHeading, altitude, type of aircraft (make/model/call sign),\n\nType of avionics/receivers in use (e.g., make/model/software series or version),\n\nNumber of satellites being tracked, if applicable,\n\nDescription of the position/navigation/timing anomaly observed, and duration of the event,\n\nConsequences/operational impact(s) of the NAVAID or GPS anomaly,\n\nActions taken to mitigate the anomaly and/or remedy provided by the ATC facility,\n\nPost flight pilot/maintenance actions taken.\n\nPilots operating an aircraft in controlled airspace under IFR shall comply with CFR \u00a7 91.187\u00a0and promptly report as soon as practical to ATC any malfunctions of navigational equipment occurring in flight; pilots should submit initial reports:\n\nImmediately, by radio to the controlling ATC facility or FSS.\n\n\nBy telephone to the nearest ATC facility controlling the airspace where the disruption was experienced.\n\nAdditionally, GPS problems should be reported, post flight, by Internet via the GPS Anomaly Reporting Form at http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/nas/gps_reports/.\n\nTo minimize ATC workload, GPS anomalies associated with known testing NOTAMs should NOT be reported in-flight to ATC in detail; EXCEPT when:\n\nGPS degradation is experienced outside the NOTAMed area,\n\n\nPilot observes any unexpected consequences (e.g., equipment failure, suspected spoofing, failure of unexpected aircraft systems, such as TAWS)."

This degradation is known as \u201cdrift.\u201d\n\n\nINSs combine the components of an IRU with an internal navigation computer.

                "section-content": "System Overview\n\nSystem Description. The Global Positioning System is a space-based radio navigation system used\u2009to determine precise position anywhere in the world. The 24 satellite constellation is designed to ensure at least five satellites are always visible to a user worldwide. A minimum of four satellites is necessary for receivers to establish an accurate three-dimensional position. The receiver uses data from satellites above the mask angle (the lowest angle\u2009above the horizon at which a receiver can use a satellite). The Department of Defense (DoD) is responsible for operating the GPS satellite constellation and monitors the GPS satellites to ensure proper operation. Each satellite's orbital parameters (ephemeris data) are sent to each satellite for broadcast as part of the data message embedded in the GPS signal. The GPS coordinate system is the Cartesian earth-centered, earth-fixed coordinates as specified in the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84).\n\n\nSystem Availability and Reliability.\n\nThe status of GPS satellites is broadcast as part of the data message transmitted by the GPS satellites. GPS status information is also available by means of the U.S. Coast Guard navigation information service: (703) 313-5907, Internet: http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/. Additionally, satellite status is available through the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system.\n\n\nGNSS operational status depends on the type of equipment being used. For GPS-only equipment TSO-C129 or TSO-C196(), the operational status of non-precision approach capability for flight planning purposes is provided through a prediction program that is embedded in the receiver or provided separately.\n\nReceiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). RAIM is the capability of a GPS receiver to perform integrity monitoring on itself by ensuring available satellite signals meet the integrity requirements for a given phase of flight. Without RAIM, the pilot has no assurance of the GPS position integrity. RAIM provides immediate feedback to the pilot. This fault detection is critical for performance-based navigation (PBN)(see paragraph 1-2-1, Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) and Area Navigation (RNAV), for an introduction to PBN), because delays of up to two hours can occur before an erroneous satellite transmission is detected and corrected by the satellite control segment.\n\nIn order for RAIM to determine if a satellite is providing corrupted information, at least one satellite, in addition to those required for navigation, must be in view for the receiver to perform the RAIM function. RAIM requires a minimum of 5 satellites, or 4 satellites and barometric altimeter input (baro-aiding), to detect an integrity anomaly. Baro-aiding is a method of augmenting the GPS integrity solution by using a non-satellite input source in lieu of the fifth satellite. Some GPS receivers also have a RAIM capability, called fault detection and exclusion (FDE), that excludes a failed satellite from the position solution; GPS receivers capable of FDE require 6 satellites or 5 satellites with baro-aiding. This allows the GPS receiver to isolate the corrupt satellite signal, remove it from the position solution, and still provide an integrity-assured position. To ensure that baro-aiding is available, enter the current altimeter setting into the receiver as described in the operating manual. Do not use the GPS derived altitude due to the large GPS vertical errors that will make the integrity monitoring function invalid.\n\n\nThere are generally two types of RAIM fault messages. The first type of message indicates that there are not enough satellites available to provide RAIM integrity monitoring. The GPS navigation solution may be acceptable, but the integrity of the solution cannot be determined. The second type indicates that the RAIM integrity monitor has detected a potential error and that there is an inconsistency in the navigation solution for the given phase of flight. Without RAIM capability, the pilot has no assurance of the accuracy of the GPS position.\n\nSelective Availability.  Selective Availability (SA) is a method by which the accuracy of GPS is intentionally degraded. This feature was designed to deny hostile use of precise GPS positioning data. SA was discontinued on May 1, 2000, but many GPS receivers are designed to assume that SA is still active. New receivers may take advantage of the discontinuance of SA based on the performance values in ICAO Annex 10.\n\n\nOperational Use of GPS. U.S. civil operators may use approved GPS equipment in oceanic airspace, certain remote areas, the National Airspace System and other States as authorized (please consult the applicable Aeronautical Information Publication). Equipage other than GPS may be required for the desired operation. GPS navigation is used for both Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations.\n\nVFR Operations\n\nGPS navigation has become an asset to VFR pilots by providing increased navigational capabilities and enhanced situational awareness. Although GPS has provided many benefits to the VFR pilot, care must be exercised to ensure that system capabilities are not exceeded. VFR pilots should integrate GPS navigation with electronic navigation (when possible), as well as pilotage and dead reckoning.\n\n\nGPS receivers used for VFR navigation vary from fully integrated IFR/VFR installation used to support VFR operations to hand-held devices. Pilots must understand the limitations of the receivers prior to using in flight to avoid misusing navigation information. (See TBL 1-1-6.) Most receivers are not intuitive. The pilot must learn the various keystrokes, knob functions, and displays that are used\u2009in the operation of the receiver. Some manufacturers provide computer-based tutorials or simulations of their receivers that pilots can use to become familiar with operating the equipment.\n\nWhen using GPS for VFR operations, RAIM capability, database currency, and antenna location are critical areas of concern.\n\nRAIM Capability. VFR GPS panel mount receivers and hand-held units have no RAIM alerting capability. This prevents the pilot from being alerted to the loss of the required number of satellites in view, or the detection of a position error. Pilots should use a systematic cross-check with other navigation techniques to verify position. Be suspicious of the GPS position if a disagreement exists between the two positions.\n\n\nDatabase Currency. Check the currency of the database.  Databases must be updated for IFR operations and should be updated for all other operations. However, there is no requirement for databases to be updated for VFR navigation. It is not recommended to use a moving map with an outdated database in and around critical airspace. Pilots using an outdated database should verify waypoints using current aeronautical products; for example, Chart Supplement, Sectional Chart, or En Route Chart.\n\nAntenna Location. The antenna location for GPS receivers used for IFR and VFR operations may differ. VFR antennae are typically placed for convenience more than performance, while IFR installations ensure a clear view is provided with the satellites. Antennae not providing a clear view have a greater opportunity to lose the satellite navigational signal. This is especially true in\u2009the case of hand-held GPS receivers. Typically, suction cups are used to place the GPS antennas on the inside of cockpit windows. While this method has great utility, the antenna location is limited to the cockpit or cabin which rarely provides a clear view of all available satellites.  Consequently, signal losses may occur due to aircraft structure blocking satellite signals, causing a loss of navigation capability. These losses, coupled with a lack of RAIM capability, could present erroneous position and navigation information with no warning to the pilot. While the use of a hand-held GPS for VFR operations is not limited by regulation, modification of the aircraft, such as installing a panel- or yoke-mounted holder, is governed by 14 CFR Part 43. Consult with your mechanic to ensure compliance with the regulation and safe installation.\n\nDo not solely rely on GPS for VFR navigation. No design standard of accuracy or integrity is used for a VFR GPS receiver. VFR GPS receivers should be used in conjunction with other forms of navigation during VFR operations to ensure a correct route of flight is maintained. Minimize head-down time in the aircraft by being familiar with your GPS receiver's operation and by keeping eyes outside scanning for traffic, terrain, and obstacles.\n\nVFR Waypoints\n\nVFR waypoints provide VFR pilots with a supplementary tool to assist with position awareness while navigating visually in aircraft equipped with area navigation receivers. VFR waypoints should be used as a tool to supplement current navigation procedures. The uses of VFR waypoints include providing navigational aids for pilots unfamiliar with an area, waypoint definition of existing reporting points, enhanced navigation in and around Class B and Class C airspace, enhanced navigation around Special Use Airspace, and entry points for commonly flown mountain passes. VFR pilots should rely on appropriate and current aeronautical charts published specifically for visual navigation. If operating in a terminal area, pilots should take advantage of the Terminal Area Chart available for that area, if published. The use of VFR waypoints does not relieve the pilot of any responsibility to comply with the operational requirements of 14 CFR Part 91.\n\n\nVFR waypoint names (for computer entry and flight plans) consist of five letters beginning with the letters \u201cVP\u201d and are retrievable from navigation databases. The VFR waypoint names are not intended to be pronounceable, and they are not for use in ATC communications. On VFR charts, stand-alone VFR waypoints will be portrayed using the same four-point star symbol used for IFR waypoints. VFR waypoints collocated with visual check-points on the chart will be identified by small magenta flag symbols. VFR waypoints collocated with visual check-points will be pronounceable based on the name of the visual check-point and may be used for ATC communications. Each VFR waypoint name will appear in parentheses adjacent to the geographic location on the chart. Latitude/longitude data for all established VFR waypoints may be found in FAA Order JO 7350.9, Location Identifiers.\n\nVFR waypoints may not be used on IFR flight plans. VFR waypoints are not recognized by the IFR system and will be rejected for IFR routing purposes.\n\nPilots may use the five-letter identifier as a waypoint in the route of flight section on a VFR flight plan. Pilots may use the VFR waypoints only when operating under VFR conditions. The point may represent an intended course change or describe the planned route of flight. This VFR filing would be similar to how a VOR would be used in a route of flight.\n\nVFR waypoints intended for use during flight should be loaded into the receiver while on the ground. Once airborne, pilots should avoid programming routes or VFR waypoint chains into their receivers.\n\nPilots should be vigilant to see and avoid other traffic when near VFR waypoints. With the increased use of GPS navigation and accuracy, expect increased traffic near VFR waypoints. Regardless of the class of airspace, monitor the available ATC frequency for traffic information on other aircraft operating in the vicinity. See paragraph 7-6-3, VFR in Congested Areas, for more information.\n\nMountain pass entry points are marked for convenience to assist pilots with flight planning and visual navigation. Do not attempt to fly a mountain pass directly from VFR waypoint to VFR waypoint\u2014they do not create a path through the mountain pass. Alternative routes are always available. It is the pilot in command's responsibility to choose a suitable route for the intended flight and known conditions.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 7-6-7, Mountain Flying.\n\n\n\nIFR Use of GPS\n\nGeneral Requirements. Authorization to conduct any GPS operation under IFR requires:\n\nGPS navigation equipment used for IFR operations must be approved in accordance with the requirements specified in Technical Standard Order (TSO) TSO-C129(), TSO-C196(), TSO-C145(), or TSO-C146(), and the installation must be done in accordance with Advisory Circular AC 20-138, Airworthiness Approval of Positioning and Navigation Systems. Equipment approved in accordance with TSO-C115a does not meet the requirements of TSO-C129. Visual flight rules (VFR) and hand-held GPS systems are not authorized for IFR navigation, instrument approaches, or as a principal instrument flight reference.\n\n\nAircraft using un-augmented GPS (TSO-C129() or TSO-C196()) for navigation under IFR must be equipped with an alternate approved and operational means of navigation suitable for navigating the proposed route of flight. (Examples of alternate navigation equipment include VOR or DME/DME/IRU capability). Active monitoring of alternative navigation equipment is not required when RAIM is available for integrity monitoring. Active monitoring of an alternate means of navigation is required when the GPS RAIM capability is lost.\n\nProcedures must be established for use in the event that the loss of RAIM capability is predicted to occur. In situations where RAIM is predicted to be unavailable, the flight must rely on other approved navigation equipment, re-route to where RAIM is available, delay departure, or cancel the flight.\n\nThe GPS operation must be conducted in accordance with the FAA-approved aircraft flight manual (AFM) or flight manual supplement. Flight crew members must be thoroughly familiar with the particular GPS equipment installed in the aircraft, the receiver operation manual, and the AFM or flight manual supplement. Operation, receiver presentation and capabilities of GPS equipment vary. Due to these differences, operation of GPS receivers of different brands, or even models of the same brand, under IFR should not be attempted without thorough operational knowledge. Most receivers have a built-in simulator mode, which allows the pilot to become familiar with operation prior to attempting operation in the aircraft.\n\nAircraft navigating by IFR-approved GPS are considered to be performance-based navigation (PBN) aircraft and have special equipment suffixes. File the appropriate equipment suffix in accordance with Appendix 4, TBL 4-2, on the ATC flight plan. If GPS avionics become inoperative, the pilot should advise ATC and amend the equipment suffix.\n\nPrior to any GPS IFR operation, the pilot must review appropriate NOTAMs and aeronautical information. (See GPS NOTAMs/Aeronautical Information).\n\n\nDatabase Requirements. The onboard navigation data must be current and appropriate for the region of intended operation and should include the navigation aids, waypoints, and relevant coded terminal airspace procedures for the departure, arrival, and alternate airfields.\n\nFurther database guidance for terminal and en route requirements may be found in AC 90-100, U.S.  Terminal and En Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations.\n\n\nFurther database guidance on Required Navigation Performance (RNP) instrument approach operations, RNP terminal, and RNP en route requirements may be found in AC 90-105, Approval Guidance for RNP Operations and Barometric Vertical Navigation in the U.S. National Airspace System.\n\nAll approach procedures to be flown must be retrievable from the current airborne navigation database supplied by the equipment manufacturer or other FAA-approved source. The system must be able to retrieve the procedure by name from the aircraft navigation database, not just as a manually entered series of waypoints. Manual entry of waypoints using latitude/longitude or place/bearing is not permitted for approach procedures.\n\nPrior to using a procedure or waypoint retrieved from the airborne navigation database, the pilot should verify the validity of the database. This verification should include the following preflight and inflight steps:\n\nPreflight:\n\nDetermine the date of database issuance, and verify that the date/time of proposed use is before the expiration date/time.\n\n\n Verify that the database provider has not published a notice limiting the use of the specific waypoint or procedure.\n\n\nInflight:\n\nDetermine that the waypoints and transition names coincide with names found on the procedure chart. Do not use waypoints which do not exactly match the spelling shown on published procedure charts.\n\n\n Determine that the waypoints are logical in location, in the correct order, and their orientation to each other is as found on the procedure chart, both laterally and vertically.\n\nNOTE-\nThere is no specific requirement to check each waypoint latitude and longitude, type of waypoint and/or altitude constraint, only the general relationship of waypoints in the procedure, or the logic of an individual waypoint's location.\n\n If the cursory check of procedure logic or individual waypoint location, specified in [b] above, indicates a potential error, do not use the retrieved procedure or waypoint until a verification of latitude and longitude, waypoint type, and altitude constraints indicate full conformity with the published data.\n\nAir carrier and commercial operators must meet the appropriate provisions of their approved operations specifications.\n\nDuring domestic operations for commerce or for hire, operators must have a second navigation system capable of reversion or contingency operations.\n\n\nOperators must have two independent navigation systems appropriate to the route to be flown or one system that is suitable and a second, independent backup system that allows the operator to proceed safely to a suitable airport, complete an instrument approach; and the aircraft must have sufficient fuel (reference 14 CFR 121.349, 125.203, 129.17, and 135.165). These rules ensure the safety of the operation by preventing a single point of failure.\n\nNOTE-\nAn aircraft approved for multi-sensor navigation and equipped with a single navigation system must maintain an ability to navigate or proceed safely in the event that any one component of the navigation system fails, including the flight management system (FMS). Retaining an FMS-independent VOR capability would satisfy this requirement.\n\nThe requirements for a second system\u2009apply to the entire set of equipment needed to achieve the navigation capability, not just the individual components of the system such as the radio navigation receiver. For example, to use two RNAV systems (e.g., GPS and DME/DME/IRU) to comply with the requirements, the aircraft must be equipped with two independent radio navigation receivers and two independent navigation computers (e.g., flight management systems (FMS)). Alternatively, to comply with the requirements using a single RNAV system with an installed and operable VOR capability, the VOR capability must be independent of the FMS.\n\nDue to low risk of disruption or manipulation of GPS signals beyond 50 NM offshore, FAA differentiates between extended and non-extended over\u2010water operations. To satisfy the requirement for two independent navigation systems:\n\nFor all extended over\u2010water operations (defined in 14 CFR Part 1 as greater than 50 NM from the nearest shoreline), operators may consider dual GPS-based systems to meet the \u201cindependent\u201d criteria stipulated by regulation, e.g., \u00a7121.349, \u00a7135.165.\n\n\nFor all \u201cnon-extended overwater\u201d operations, if the primary navigation system is GPS\u2010based, the second system must be independent of GPS (for example, VOR or DME/DME/IRU). This allows continued navigation in case of failure of the GPS or WAAS services. Recognizing that GPS interference and test events resulting in the loss of GPS services have become more common, the FAA requires operators conducting IFR operations under 14 CFR 121.349, 125.203, 129.17, and 135.65 to retain a non-GPS navigation capability, for example, either DME/DME, IRU, or VOR for en route and terminal operations and VOR and ILS for final approach. Since this system is to be used as a reversionary capability, single equipage is sufficient.\n\nOceanic, Domestic, En Route, and Terminal Area Operations\n\nConduct GPS IFR operations in oceanic areas only when approved avionics systems are installed. TSO-C196() users and TSO-C129() GPS users authorized for Class A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, or C2 operations may use GPS in place of another approved means of long-range navigation, such as dual INS. (See TBL 1-1-5 and TBL 1-1-6.) Aircraft with a single installation GPS, meeting the above specifications, are authorized to operate on short oceanic routes requiring one means of long-range navigation (reference AC 20-138, Appendix 1).\n\n\nConduct GPS domestic, en route, and terminal IFR operations only when approved avionics systems are installed. Pilots may use GPS via TSO-C129() authorized for Class A1, B1, B3, C1, or C3 operations GPS via TSO-C196(); or GPS/WAAS with either TSO-C145() or TSO-C146(). When using TSO-C129() or TSO-C196() receivers, the avionics necessary to receive all of the ground-based facilities appropriate for the route to the destination airport and any required alternate airport must be installed and operational. Ground-based facilities necessary for these routes must be operational.\n\nGPS en route IFR operations may be conducted in Alaska outside the operational service volume of ground-based navigation aids when a TSO-C145() or TSO-C146() GPS/wide area augmentation system (WAAS) system is installed and operating. WAAS is the U.S. version of a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS).\n\nIn Alaska, aircraft may operate on GNSS Q-routes with GPS (TSO-C129 () or TSO-C196 ()) equipment while the aircraft remains in Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar surveillance or with GPS/WAAS (TSO-C145 () or TSO-C146 ()) which does not require ATC radar surveillance.\n\n\nIn Alaska, aircraft may only operate on GNSS T-routes with GPS/WAAS (TSO-C145 () or TSO-C146 ()) equipment.\n\n\nGround-based navigation equipment is not required to be installed and operating for en route IFR operations when using GPS/WAAS navigation systems. All operators should ensure that an alternate means of navigation is available in the unlikely event the GPS/WAAS navigation system becomes inoperative.\n\nQ-routes and T-routes outside Alaska. Q-routes require system performance currently met by GPS, GPS/WAAS, or DME/DME/IRU RNAV systems that satisfy the criteria discussed in AC 90-100, U.S. Terminal and En Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations. T-routes require GPS or GPS/WAAS equipment.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-3-4, Airways and Route Systems.\n\n\nGPS IFR approach/departure operations can be conducted when approved avionics systems are installed and the following requirements are met:\n\nThe aircraft is TSO-C145() or TSO-C146() or TSO-C196() or TSO-C129() in Class A1, B1, B3, C1, or C3; and\n\n\nThe approach/departure must be retrievable from the current airborne navigation database in the navigation computer. The system must be able to retrieve the procedure by name from the aircraft navigation database. Manual entry of waypoints using latitude/longitude or place/bearing is not permitted for approach procedures.\n\nThe authorization to fly instrument approaches/departures with GPS is limited to U.S. airspace.\n\nThe use of GPS in any other airspace must be expressly authorized by the FAA Administrator.\n\nGPS instrument approach/departure operations outside the U.S. must be authorized  by the appropriate sovereign authority.\n\nDepartures and Instrument Departure Procedures (DPs)\nThe GPS receiver must be set to terminal (\u00b11 NM) CDI sensitivity and the navigation routes contained in the database in order to fly published IFR charted departures and DPs. Terminal RAIM should be automatically provided by the receiver. (Terminal RAIM for departure may not be available unless the waypoints are part of the active flight plan rather than proceeding direct to the first destination.) Certain segments of a DP may require some manual intervention by the pilot, especially when radar vectored to a course or required to intercept a specific course to a waypoint. The database may not contain all of the transitions or departures from all runways and some GPS receivers do not contain DPs in the database.  It is necessary that helicopter procedures be flown at 70 knots or less since helicopter departure procedures and missed approaches use a 20:1 obstacle clearance surface (OCS), which is double the fixed-wing OCS, and turning areas are based on this speed as well.\nGPS Instrument Approach Procedures\n\nGPS overlay approaches are designated non-precision instrument approach procedures that pilots are authorized to fly using GPS avionics. Localizer (LOC), localizer type directional aid (LDA), and simplified directional facility (SDF) procedures are not authorized. Overlay procedures are identified by the \u201cname of the procedure\u201d and \u201cor GPS\u201d (e.g., VOR/DME or GPS RWY 15) in the title. Authorized procedures must be retrievable from a current onboard navigation database. The navigation database may also enhance position orientation by displaying a map containing information on conventional NAVAID approaches. This approach information should not be confused with a GPS overlay approach (see the receiver operating manual, AFM, or AFM Supplement for details on how to identify these approaches in the navigation database).\n\nNOTE-\nOverlay approaches do not adhere to the design criteria described in paragraph 5-4-5m, Area Navigation (RNAV) Instrument Approach Charts, for stand-alone GPS approaches. Overlay approach criteria is based on the design criteria used for ground-based NAVAID approaches.\n\n\nStand-alone approach procedures specifically designed for GPS systems have replaced many of the original overlay approaches. All approaches that contain \u201cGPS\u201d in the title (e.g., \u201cVOR or GPS RWY 24,\u201d \u201cGPS RWY 24,\u201d or \u201cRNAV (GPS) RWY 24\u201d) can be flown using GPS. GPS-equipped aircraft do not need underlying ground-based NAVAIDs or associated aircraft avionics to fly the approach. Monitoring the underlying approach with ground-based NAVAIDs is suggested when able. Existing overlay approaches may be requested using the GPS title; for example, the VOR or GPS RWY 24 may be requested as \u201cGPS RWY 24.\u201d Some GPS procedures have a Terminal Arrival Area (TAA) with an underlining RNAV approach.\n\nFor flight planning purposes, TSO-C129() and TSO-C196()-equipped users (GPS users) whose navigation systems have fault detection and exclusion (FDE) capability, who perform a preflight RAIM prediction for the approach integrity at the airport where the RNAV (GPS) approach will be flown, and have proper knowledge and any required training and/or approval to conduct a GPS-based IAP, may file based on a GPS-based IAP at either the destination or the alternate airport, but not at both locations. At the alternate airport, pilots may plan for:\n\nLateral navigation (LNAV) or circling minimum descent altitude (MDA);\n\n\nLNAV/vertical navigation (LNAV/VNAV) DA, if equipped with and using approved barometric vertical navigation (baro-VNAV) equipment;\n\nRNP 0.3 DA on an RNAV (RNP) IAP, if they are specifically authorized users using approved baro-VNAV equipment and the pilot has verified required navigation performance (RNP) availability through an approved prediction program.\n\nIf the above conditions cannot be met, any required alternate airport must have an approved instrument approach procedure other than GPS-based that is anticipated to be operational and available at the estimated time of arrival, and which the aircraft is equipped to fly.\n\nProcedures for Accomplishing GPS Approaches\n\nAn RNAV (GPS) procedure may be associated with a Terminal Arrival Area (TAA). The basic design of the RNAV procedure is the \u201cT\u201d design or a modification of the \u201cT\u201d (See Paragraph 5-4-5d, Terminal Arrival Area (TAA), for complete information).\n\n\nPilots cleared by ATC for an RNAV (GPS) approach should fly the full approach from an Initial Approach Waypoint (IAWP) or feeder fix. Randomly joining an approach at an intermediate fix does not assure terrain clearance.\n\nWhen an approach has been loaded in the navigation system, GPS receivers will give an \u201carm\u201d annunciation 30 NM straight line distance from the airport/heliport reference point. Pilots should arm the approach mode at this time if not already armed (some receivers arm automatically).  Without arming, the receiver will not change from en\u2009route CDI and RAIM sensitivity of \u00b15 NM either side of centerline to \u00b11 NM terminal sensitivity.  Where the IAWP is inside this 30 mile point, a CDI sensitivity change will occur once the approach mode is armed and the aircraft is inside 30 NM.  Where the IAWP is beyond 30 NM from the airport/heliport reference point and the approach is armed, the CDI sensitivity will not change until the aircraft is within 30 miles of the airport/heliport reference point.  Feeder route obstacle clearance is predicated on the receiver being in terminal (\u00b11 NM) CDI sensitivity and RAIM within 30 NM of the  airport/heliport reference point;  therefore, the receiver should always be armed (if required) not later than the 30 NM annunciation.\n\nThe pilot must be aware of what bank angle/turn rate the particular receiver uses to compute turn anticipation, and whether wind and airspeed are included in the receiver's calculations. This information should be in the receiver operating manual. Over or under banking the turn onto the final approach course may significantly delay getting on course and may result in high descent rates to achieve the next segment altitude.\n\nWhen within 2 NM of the Final Approach Waypoint (FAWP) with the approach mode armed, the approach mode will switch to active, which results in RAIM and CDI changing to approach sensitivity. Beginning 2 NM prior to the FAWP, the full scale CDI sensitivity will smoothly change from \u00b11 NM to \u00b10.3 NM at the FAWP. As sensitivity changes from \u00b11 NM to \u00b10.3\u2009NM approaching the FAWP, with the CDI not centered, the corresponding increase in CDI displacement may give the impression that the aircraft is moving further away from the intended course even though it is on an acceptable intercept heading. Referencing the digital track displacement information (cross track error), if it is available in the approach mode, may help the pilot remain position oriented in this situation. Being established on the final approach course prior to the beginning of the sensitivity change at 2 NM will help prevent problems in interpreting the CDI display during ramp down. Therefore, requesting or accepting vectors which will cause the aircraft to intercept the final approach course within 2 NM of the FAWP is not recommended.\n\nWhen receiving vectors to final, most receiver operating manuals suggest placing the receiver in the non-sequencing mode on the FAWP and manually setting the course.  This provides an extended final approach course in cases where the aircraft is vectored onto the final approach course outside of any existing segment which is aligned with the runway. Assigned altitudes must be maintained until established on a published segment of the approach. Required altitudes at waypoints outside the FAWP or stepdown fixes must be considered. Calculating the distance to the FAWP may be required in order to descend at the proper location.\n\nOverriding an automatically selected sensitivity during an approach will cancel the approach mode annunciation. If the approach mode is not armed by 2 NM prior to the FAWP, the approach mode will not become active at 2 NM prior to the FAWP, and the equipment will flag. In these conditions, the RAIM and CDI sensitivity will not ramp down, and the pilot should not descend to MDA, but fly to the MAWP and execute a missed approach. The approach active annunciator and/or the receiver should be checked to ensure the approach mode is active prior to the FAWP.\n\nDo not attempt to fly an approach unless the procedure in the onboard database is current and identified as \u201cGPS\u201d on the approach chart. The navigation database may contain information about non-overlay approach procedures that enhances position orientation generally by providing a map, while flying these approaches using conventional NAVAIDs. This approach information should not be confused with a GPS overlay approach (see the receiver operating manual, AFM, or AFM Supplement for details on how to identify these procedures in the navigation database). Flying point to point on the approach does not assure compliance with the published approach procedure. The proper RAIM sensitivity will not be available and the CDI sensitivity  will not automatically change to \u00b10.3 NM. Manually setting CDI sensitivity does not automatically change the RAIM sensitivity on some receivers. Some existing non-precision approach procedures cannot be coded for use with GPS and will not be available as overlays.\n\nPilots should pay particular attention to\u2009the exact operation of their GPS receivers for performing holding patterns and in the case of overlay approaches, operations such as procedure turns. These procedures may require manual intervention by the pilot to stop the sequencing of waypoints by the receiver and to resume automatic GPS navigation sequencing once the maneuver is complete. The same waypoint may appear in the route of flight more than once consecutively (for example, IAWP, FAWP, MAHWP on a procedure turn). Care must be exercised to ensure that the receiver is sequenced to the appropriate waypoint for the segment of the procedure being flown, especially if one or more fly-overs are skipped (for example, FAWP rather than IAWP if the procedure turn is not flown). The pilot may have to sequence past one or more fly-overs of the same waypoint in order to start GPS automatic sequencing at the proper place in the sequence of waypoints.\n\nIncorrect inputs into the GPS receiver are especially critical during approaches. In some cases, an incorrect entry can cause the receiver to leave the approach mode.\n\nA fix on an overlay approach identified by a DME fix will not be in the waypoint sequence on the GPS receiver unless there is a published name assigned to it. When a name is assigned, the along track distance (ATD) to the waypoint may be zero rather than the DME stated on the approach chart. The pilot should be alert for this on any overlay procedure where the original approach used DME.\n\nIf a visual descent point (VDP) is published, it will not be included in the sequence of waypoints. Pilots are expected to use normal piloting techniques for beginning the visual descent, such as ATD.\n\nUnnamed stepdown fixes in the final approach segment may or may not be coded in the waypoint sequence of the aircraft's navigation database and must be identified using ATD. Stepdown fixes in the final approach segment of RNAV (GPS) approaches are being named, in addition to being identified by ATD. However, GPS avionics may or may not accommodate waypoints between the FAF and MAP. Pilots must know the capabilities of their GPS equipment and continue to identify stepdown fixes using ATD when necessary.\n\nMissed Approach\n\nA GPS missed approach requires pilot action to sequence the receiver past the MAWP to the missed approach portion of the procedure. The pilot must be thoroughly familiar with the activation procedure for the particular GPS receiver installed in the aircraft and must initiate appropriate action after the MAWP. Activating the missed approach prior to the MAWP will cause CDI sensitivity to immediately change to terminal (\u00b11NM) sensitivity and the receiver will continue to navigate to the MAWP. The receiver will not sequence past the MAWP. Turns should not begin prior to the MAWP. If the missed approach is not activated, the GPS receiver will display an extension of the inbound final approach course and the ATD will increase from the MAWP until it is manually sequenced after crossing the MAWP.\n\n\nMissed approach routings in which the first track is via a course rather than direct to the next waypoint require additional action by the pilot to set the course. Being familiar with all of the inputs required is especially critical during this phase of flight.\n\nReceiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM)\n\nRAIM outages may occur due to an insufficient number of satellites or due to unsuitable satellite geometry which causes the error in the position solution to become too large. Loss of satellite reception and RAIM warnings may occur due to aircraft dynamics (changes in pitch or bank angle). Antenna location on the aircraft, satellite position relative to the horizon, and aircraft attitude may affect reception of one or more satellites. Since the relative positions of the satellites are constantly changing, prior experience with the airport does not guarantee reception at all times, and RAIM availability should always be checked.\n\n\nCivilian pilots may obtain GPS RAIM availability information for nonprecision approach procedures by using a manufacturer-supplied RAIM prediction tool, or using the Service Availability Prediction Tool (SAPT) on the FAA en route and terminal RAIM prediction website. Pilots can also request GPS RAIM aeronautical information from a flight service station during preflight briefings. GPS RAIM aeronautical information can be obtained for a period of 3 hours (for example, if you are scheduled to arrive at 1215 hours, then the GPS RAIM information is available from 1100 to 1400 hours) or a 24-hour timeframe at a particular airport. FAA briefers will provide RAIM information for a period of 1 hour before to 1 hour after the ETA hour, unless a specific timeframe is requested by the pilot. If flying a published GPS departure, a RAIM prediction should also be requested for the departure airport.\n\nThe military provides airfield specific GPS RAIM NOTAMs for nonprecision approach procedures at military airfields. The RAIM outages are issued as M-series NOTAMs and may be obtained for up to 24 hours from the time of request.\n\nReceiver manufacturers and/or database suppliers may supply \u201cNOTAM\u201d type information concerning database errors. Pilots should check these sources when available, to ensure that they have the most current information concerning their electronic database.\n\nIf RAIM is not available, use another type of navigation and approach system; select another route or destination; or delay the trip until RAIM is predicted to be available on arrival. On longer flights, pilots should consider rechecking the RAIM prediction for the destination during the flight. This may provide an early indication that an unscheduled satellite outage has occurred since takeoff.\n\nIf a RAIM failure/status annunciation occurs prior to the final approach waypoint (FAWP), the approach should not be completed since GPS no longer provides the required integrity. The receiver performs a RAIM prediction by 2 NM prior to the FAWP to ensure that RAIM is available as a condition for entering the approach mode. The pilot should ensure the receiver has sequenced from \u201cArmed\u201d to \u201cApproach\u201d prior to the FAWP (normally occurs 2 NM prior). Failure to sequence may be an indication of the detection of a satellite anomaly, failure to arm the receiver (if required), or other problems which preclude flying the approach.\n\nIf the receiver does not sequence into the approach mode or a RAIM failure/status annunciation occurs prior to the FAWP, the pilot must not initiate the approach nor descend, but instead, proceed to the missed approach waypoint (MAWP) via the FAWP, perform a missed approach, and contact ATC as soon as practical. The GPS receiver may continue to operate after a RAIM flag/status annunciation appears, but the navigation information should be considered advisory only. Refer to the receiver operating manual for specific indications and instructions associated with loss of RAIM prior to the FAF.\n\nIf the RAIM flag/status annunciation appears after the FAWP, the pilot should initiate a climb and execute the missed approach. The GPS receiver may continue to operate after a RAIM flag/status annunciation appears, but the navigation information should be considered advisory only. Refer to the receiver operating manual for operating mode information during a RAIM annunciation.\n\nWaypoints\n\nGPS receivers navigate from one defined point to another retrieved from the aircraft's onboard navigational database. These points are waypoints (5-letter pronounceable name), existing VHF intersections, DME fixes with 5-letter pronounceable names and 3-letter NAVAID IDs. Each waypoint is a geographical location defined by a latitude/longitude geographic coordinate. These 5-letter waypoints, VHF intersections, 5-letter pronounceable DME fixes and 3-letter NAVAID IDs are published on various FAA aeronautical navigation products (IFR Enroute Charts, VFR Charts, Terminal Procedures Publications, etc.).\n\n\nA Computer Navigation Fix (CNF) is also a point defined by a latitude/longitude coordinate and is required to support Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) operations. The GPS receiver uses CNFs in conjunction with waypoints to navigate from point to point. However, CNFs are not recognized by ATC. ATC does not maintain CNFs in their database and they do not use CNFs for any air traffic control purpose. CNFs may or may not be charted on FAA aeronautical navigation products, are listed in the chart legends, and are for advisory purposes only. Pilots are not to use CNFs for point to point navigation (proceed direct), filing a flight plan, or in aircraft/ATC communications. CNFs that do appear on aeronautical charts allow pilots increased situational awareness by identifying points in the aircraft database route of flight with points on the aeronautical chart. CNFs are random five-letter identifiers, not pronounceable like waypoints and placed in parenthesis. Eventually, all CNFs will begin with the letters \u201cCF\u201d followed by three consonants (for example, CFWBG). This five-letter identifier will be found next to an \u201cx\u201d on enroute charts and possibly on an approach chart. On instrument approach procedures (charts) in the terminal procedures publication, CNFs may represent unnamed DME fixes, beginning and ending points of DME arcs, and sensor (ground-based signal i.e., VOR, NDB, ILS) final approach fixes on GPS overlay approaches. These CNFs provide the GPS with points on the procedure that allow the overlay approach to mirror the ground-based sensor approach. These points should only be used by the GPS system for navigation and should not be used by pilots for any other purpose on the approach. The CNF concept has not been adopted or recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\n\nGPS approaches use fly-over and fly-by waypoints to join route segments on an approach. Fly-by waypoints connect the two segments by allowing the aircraft to turn prior to the current waypoint in order to roll out on course to the next waypoint. This is known as turn anticipation and is compensated for in the airspace and terrain clearances. The missed approach waypoint (MAWP) will always be a fly-over waypoint. A holding waypoint will always be designed as a fly-over waypoint in the navigational database but may be charted as a fly-by event unless the holding waypoint is used for another purpose in the procedure and both events require the waypoint to be a fly-over event. Some waypoints may have dual use; for example, as a fly-by waypoint when used as an IF for a NoPT route and as a fly-over waypoint when the same waypoint is also used as an IAF/IF hold-in-lieu of PT. Since the waypoint can only be charted one way, when this situation occurs, the fly-by waypoint symbol will be charted in all uses of the waypoint.\n\nUnnamed waypoints for each airport will be uniquely identified in the database. Although the identifier may be used at different airports (for example, RW36 will be the identifier at each airport with a runway 36), the actual point, at each airport, is defined by a specific latitude/longitude coordinate.\n\nThe runway threshold waypoint, normally the MAWP, may have a five-letter identifier (for example, SNEEZ) or be coded as RW## (for example, RW36, RW36L). MAWPs located at the runway threshold are being changed to the RW## identifier, while MAWPs not located at the threshold will have a five-letter identifier. This may cause the approach chart to differ from the aircraft database until all changes are complete. The runway threshold waypoint is also used as the center of the Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) on most GPS approaches.\n\nPosition Orientation. Pilots should pay particular attention to position orientation while using GPS. Distance and track information are provided to the next active waypoint, not to a fixed navigation aid. Receivers may sequence when the pilot is not flying along an active route, such as when being vectored or deviating for weather, due to the proximity to another waypoint in the route. This can be prevented by placing the receiver in the non-sequencing mode. When the receiver is in the non-sequencing mode, bearing and distance are provided to the selected waypoint and the receiver will not sequence to the next waypoint in the route until placed back in the auto sequence mode or the pilot selects a different waypoint. The pilot may have to compute the ATD to stepdown fixes and other points on overlay approaches, due to the receiver showing ATD to the next waypoint rather than DME to the VOR or ILS ground station.\n\nImpact of Magnetic Variation on PBN Systems\n\nDifferences may exist between PBN systems and the charted magnetic courses on ground-based NAVAID instrument flight procedures (IFP), enroute charts, approach charts, and Standard Instrument Departure/Standard Terminal Arrival (SID/STAR) charts. These differences are due to the magnetic variance used to calculate the magnetic course. Every leg of an instrument procedure is first computed along a desired ground track with reference to true north. A magnetic variation correction is then applied to the true course in order to calculate a magnetic course for publication. The type of procedure will determine what magnetic variation value is added to the true course. A ground-based NAVAID IFP applies the facility magnetic variation of record to the true course to get the charted magnetic course. Magnetic courses on PBN procedures are calculated two different ways. SID/STAR procedures use the airport magnetic variation of record, while IFR enroute charts use magnetic reference bearing. PBN systems make a correction to true north by adding a magnetic variation calculated with an algorithm based on aircraft position, or by adding the magnetic variation coded in their navigational database. This may result in the PBN system and the procedure designer using a different magnetic variation, which causes the magnetic course displayed by the PBN system and the magnetic course charted on the IFP plate to be different. It is important to understand, however, that PBN systems, (with the exception of VOR/DME RNAV equipment) navigate by reference to true north and display magnetic course only for pilot reference. As such, a properly functioning PBN system, containing a current and accurate navigational database, should fly the correct ground track for any loaded instrument procedure, despite differences in displayed magnetic course that may be attributed to magnetic variation application. Should significant differences between the approach chart and the PBN system avionics' application of the navigation database arise, the published approach chart, supplemented by NOTAMs, holds precedence.\n\n\nThe course into a waypoint may not always be 180 degrees different from the course leaving the previous waypoint, due to the PBN system avionics' computation of geodesic paths, distance between waypoints, and differences in magnetic variation application. Variations in distances may also occur since PBN system distance-to-waypoint values are ATDs computed to the next waypoint and the DME values published on underlying procedures are slant-range distances measured to the station. This difference increases with aircraft altitude and proximity to the NAVAID.\n\nGPS Familiarization\nPilots should practice GPS approaches in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) until thoroughly proficient with all aspects of their equipment (receiver and installation) prior to attempting flight in\u2009instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Pilots should be proficient in the following areas:\nUsing the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) prediction function;\n\n\nInserting a DP into the flight plan, including setting terminal CDI sensitivity, if required, and the conditions under which terminal RAIM is available for departure;\n\nProgramming the destination airport;\n\nProgramming and flying the approaches (especially procedure turns and arcs);\n\nChanging to another approach after selecting an approach;\n\nProgramming and flying \u201cdirect\u201d missed approaches;\n\nProgramming and flying \u201crouted\u201d missed approaches;\n\nEntering, flying, and exiting holding patterns, particularly on approaches with a second waypoint in the holding pattern;\n\nProgramming and flying a \u201croute\u201d from a holding pattern;\n\nProgramming and flying an approach with radar vectors to the intermediate segment;\n\nIndication of the actions required for RAIM failure both before and after the FAWP; and\n\nProgramming a radial and distance from a VOR (often used in departure instructions).\nTBL 1-1-5GPS IFR Equipment Classes/Categories\n\n\n\nTSO-C129\n\n\n\n\nEquipment Class\n\n\nRAIM\n\n\nInt.

                "section-title": "Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)",
                "section-content": "General\n\nThe FAA developed the WAAS to improve the accuracy, integrity and availability of GPS signals. WAAS will allow GPS to be used, as the aviation navigation system, from takeoff through approach when it is complete. WAAS is a critical component of the FAA's strategic objective for a seamless satellite navigation system for civil aviation, improving capacity and safety.\n\n\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has defined Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS) such as WAAS. India and Europe are building similar systems: EGNOS, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System; and India's GPS and Geo-Augmented Navigation (GAGAN) system. The merging of these systems will create an expansive navigation capability similar to GPS, but with greater accuracy, availability, and integrity.\n\nUnlike traditional ground-based navigation aids, WAAS will cover a more extensive service area. Precisely surveyed wide-area reference stations (WRS) are linked to form the U.S. WAAS network. Signals from the GPS satellites are monitored by these WRSs to determine satellite clock and ephemeris corrections and to model the propagation effects of the ionosphere. Each station in the network relays the data to a wide-area master station (WMS) where the correction information is computed. A correction message is prepared and uplinked to a geostationary earth orbit satellite (GEO) via a GEO uplink subsystem (GUS) which is located at the ground earth station (GES). The message is then broadcast on the same frequency as GPS (L1, 1575.42 MHz) to WAAS receivers within the broadcast coverage area of the WAAS GEO.\n\nIn addition to providing the correction signal, the WAAS GEO provides an additional pseudorange measurement to the aircraft receiver, improving the availability of GPS by providing, in effect, an additional GPS satellite in view. The integrity of GPS is improved through real-time monitoring, and the accuracy is improved by providing differential corrections to reduce errors. The performance improvement is sufficient to enable approach procedures with GPS/WAAS glide paths (vertical guidance).\n\nThe FAA has completed installation of 3 GEO satellite links, 38 WRSs, 3 WMSs, 6 GES, and the required terrestrial communications to support the WAAS network including 2 operational control centers. Prior to the commissioning of the WAAS for public use, the FAA conducted a series of test and validation activities. Future dual frequency operations are planned.\n\nGNSS navigation, including GPS and WAAS, is referenced to the WGS-84 coordinate system. It should only be used where the Aeronautical Information Publications (including electronic data and aeronautical charts) conform to WGS-84 or equivalent. Other countries' civil aviation authorities may impose additional limitations on the use of their SBAS systems.\n\n\nInstrument Approach Capabilities\n\nA class of approach procedures which provide vertical guidance, but which do not meet the ICAO Annex 10 requirements for precision approaches has been developed to support satellite navigation use for aviation applications worldwide. These procedures are not precision and are referred to as Approach with Vertical Guidance (APV), are defined in ICAO Annex 6, and include approaches such as the LNAV/VNAV and localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV). These approaches provide vertical guidance, but do not meet the more stringent standards of a precision approach. Properly certified WAAS receivers will be able to fly to LPV minima and LNAV/VNAV minima, using a WAAS electronic glide path, which eliminates the errors that can be introduced by using Barometric altimetry.\n\n\nLPV minima takes advantage of the high accuracy guidance and increased integrity provided by WAAS. This WAAS generated angular guidance allows the use of the same TERPS approach criteria used for ILS approaches. LPV minima may have a decision altitude as low as 200 feet height above touchdown with visibility minimums as low as 1/2 mile, when the terrain and airport infrastructure support the lowest minima. LPV minima is published on the RNAV (GPS) approach charts (see paragraph 5-4-5, Instrument Approach Procedure Charts).\n\nA different WAAS-based line of minima, called Localizer Performance (LP) is being added in locations where the terrain or obstructions do not allow publication of vertically guided LPV minima. LP takes advantage of the angular lateral guidance and smaller position errors provided by WAAS to provide a lateral only procedure similar to an ILS Localizer. LP procedures may provide lower minima than a LNAV procedure due to the narrower obstacle clearance surface.\n\nNOTE-\nWAAS receivers certified prior to TSO-C145b and TSO-C146b, even if they have LPV capability, do not contain LP capability unless the receiver has been upgraded. Receivers capable of flying LP procedures must contain a statement in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM), AFM Supplement, or Approved Supplemental Flight Manual stating that the receiver has LP capability, as well as the capability for the other WAAS and GPS approach procedure types.\n\nWAAS provides a level of service that supports all phases of flight, including RNAV (GPS) approaches to LNAV, LP, LNAV/VNAV, and LPV lines of minima, within system coverage. Some locations close to the edge of the coverage may have a lower availability of vertical guidance.\n\nGeneral Requirements\n\nWAAS avionics must be certified in accordance with Technical Standard Order (TSO) TSO-C145(), Airborne Navigation Sensors Using the (GPS) Augmented by the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS); or TSO-C146(), Stand-Alone Airborne Navigation Equipment Using the Global Positioning System (GPS) Augmented by the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), and installed in accordance with AC 20-138, Airworthiness Approval of Positioning and Navigation Systems.\n\n\nGPS/WAAS operation must be conducted in accordance with the FAA-approved aircraft flight manual (AFM) and flight manual supplements. Flight manual supplements will state the level of approach procedure that the receiver supports. IFR approved WAAS receivers support all GPS only operations as long as lateral capability at the appropriate level is functional. WAAS monitors both GPS and WAAS satellites and provides integrity.\n\nGPS/WAAS equipment is inherently capable of supporting oceanic and remote operations if the operator obtains a fault detection and exclusion (FDE) prediction program.\n\nAir carrier and commercial operators must meet the appropriate provisions of their approved operations specifications.\n\nPrior to GPS/WAAS IFR operation, the pilot must review appropriate Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs) and aeronautical information. This information is available on request from a Flight Service Station. The FAA will provide NOTAMs to advise pilots of the status of the WAAS and level of service available.\n\nThe term MAY NOT BE AVBL is used in conjunction with WAAS NOTAMs and indicates that due to ionospheric conditions, lateral guidance may still be available when vertical guidance is unavailable. Under certain conditions, both lateral and vertical guidance may be unavailable. This NOTAM language is an advisory to pilots indicating the expected level of WAAS service (LNAV/VNAV, LPV, LP) may not be available.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n!FDC FDC NAV WAAS VNAV/LPV/LP MINIMA MAY NOT BE AVBL 1306111330-1306141930EST \nor \n!FDC FDC NAV WAAS VNAV/LPV MINIMA NOT AVBL, WAAS LP MINIMA MAY NOT BE AVBL 1306021200-1306031200ESTWAAS MAY NOT BE AVBL NOTAMs are predictive in nature and published for flight planning purposes. Upon commencing an approach at locations NOTAMed WAAS MAY NOT BE AVBL, if the WAAS avionics indicate LNAV/VNAV or LPV service is available, then vertical guidance may be used to complete the approach using the displayed level of service. Should an outage occur during the approach, reversion to LNAV minima or an alternate instrument approach procedure may be required. When GPS testing NOTAMS are published and testing is actually occurring, Air Traffic Control will advise pilots requesting or cleared for a GPS or RNAV (GPS) approach that GPS may not be available and request intentions. If pilots have reported GPS anomalies, Air Traffic Control will request the pilot's intentions and/or clear the pilot for an alternate approach, if available and operational.\n\n\nWAAS area-wide NOTAMs are originated when WAAS assets are out of service and impact the service area. Area-wide WAAS NOT AVAILABLE (AVBL) NOTAMs indicate loss or malfunction of the WAAS system. In flight, Air Traffic Control will advise pilots requesting a GPS or RNAV (GPS) approach of WAAS NOT AVBL NOTAMs if not contained in the ATIS broadcast.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nFor unscheduled loss of signal or service, an example NOTAM is: !FDC FDC NAV WAAS NOT AVBL 1311160600- 1311191200EST.  \nFor scheduled loss of signal or service, an example NOTAM is: !FDC FDC NAV WAAS NOT AVBL 1312041015- 1312082000EST.\nSite-specific WAAS MAY NOT BE AVBL NOTAMs indicate an expected level of service; for example, LNAV/VNAV, LP, or LPV may not be available. Pilots must request site-specific WAAS NOTAMs during flight planning. In flight, Air Traffic Control will not advise pilots of WAAS MAY NOT BE AVBL NOTAMs.\n\nNOTE-\nThough currently unavailable, the FAA is updating its prediction tool software to provide this site-service in the future.\n\nMost of North America has redundant coverage by two or more geostationary satellites. One exception is the northern slope of Alaska. If there is a problem with the satellite providing coverage to this area, a NOTAM similar to the following example will be issued:\n\nEXAMPLE-\n!FDC 4/3406 (PAZA A0173/14) ZAN NAV WAAS SIGNAL MAY NOT BE AVBL NORTH OF LINE FROM 7000N150000W TO 6400N16400W. RMK WAAS USERS SHOULD CONFIRM RAIM AVAILABILITY FOR IFR OPERATIONS IN THIS AREA. T-ROUTES IN THIS SECTOR NOT AVBL. ANY REQUIRED ALTERNATE AIRPORT IN THIS AREA MUST HAVE AN APPROVED INSTRUMENT APPROACH PROCEDURE OTHER THAN GPS THAT IS ANTICIPATED TO BE OPERATIONAL AND AVAILABLE AT THE ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL AND WHICH THE AIRCRAFT IS EQUIPPED TO FLY. 1406030812-1406050812EST .\nWhen GPS-testing NOTAMS are published and testing is actually occurring, Air Traffic Control will advise pilots requesting or cleared for a GPS or RNAV (GPS) approach that GPS may not be available and request intentions. If pilots have reported GPS anomalies, Air Traffic Control will request the pilot's intentions and/or clear the pilot for an alternate approach, if available and operational.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nHere is an example of a GPS testing NOTAM: \n!GPS 06/001 ZAB NAV GPS (INCLUDING WAAS, GBAS, AND ADS-B) MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE WITHIN A 468NM RADIUS CENTERED AT 330702N1062540W (TCS 093044) FL400-UNL DECREASING IN AREA WITH A DECREASE IN ALTITUDE DEFINED AS: 425NM RADIUS AT FL250, 360NM RADIUS AT 10000FT, 354NM RADIUS AT 4000FT AGL, 327NM RADIUS AT 50FT AGL. 1406070300-1406071200.\nWhen the approach chart is annotated with the  symbol, site-specific WAAS MAY NOT BE AVBL NOTAMs or Air Traffic advisories are not provided for outages in WAAS LNAV/VNAV and LPV vertical service. Vertical outages may occur daily at these locations due to being close to the edge of WAAS system coverage. Use LNAV or circling minima for flight planning at these locations, whether as a destination or alternate. For flight operations at these locations, when the WAAS avionics indicate that LNAV/VNAV or LPV service is available, then the vertical guidance may be used to complete the approach using the displayed level of service. Should an outage occur during the procedure, reversion to LNAV minima may be required.\n\nNOTE-\nArea-wide WAAS NOT AVBL NOTAMs apply to all airports in the WAAS NOT AVBL area designated in the NOTAM, including approaches at airports where an approach chart is annotated with the  symbol.\n\nGPS/WAAS was developed to be used within GEO coverage over North America without the need for other radio navigation equipment appropriate to the route of flight to be flown. Outside the WAAS coverage or in the event of a WAAS failure, GPS/WAAS equipment reverts to GPS-only operation and satisfies the requirements for basic GPS equipment. (See paragraph 1-1-17 for these requirements).\n\nUnlike TSO-C129 avionics, which were certified as a supplement to other means of navigation, WAAS avionics are evaluated without reliance on other navigation systems. As such, installation of WAAS avionics does not require the aircraft to have other equipment appropriate to the route to be flown. (See paragraph 1-1-17\u2009d for more information on equipment requirements.)\n\nPilots with WAAS receivers may flight plan to use any instrument approach procedure authorized for use with their WAAS avionics as the\u2009planned approach at a required alternate, with the\u2009following restrictions. When using WAAS at an\u2009alternate airport, flight planning must be based on\u2009flying the RNAV (GPS) LNAV or circling minima line, or\u2009minima on a GPS approach procedure, or conventional approach procedure with \u201cor GPS\u201d in the title. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 91 non-precision weather requirements must be used for planning. Upon arrival at an alternate, when the WAAS navigation system indicates that LNAV/VNAV or LPV service is available, then vertical guidance may be used to complete the approach using the displayed level of service. The FAA has begun removing the  NA (Alternate Minimums Not Authorized) symbol from select RNAV (GPS) and GPS approach procedures so they may be used by approach approved WAAS receivers at alternate airports. Some approach procedures will still require the  NA for other reasons, such as no weather reporting, so it cannot be removed from all procedures. Since every procedure must be individually evaluated, removal of the \u2009NA from RNAV (GPS) and GPS procedures will take some time.\n\nNOTE-\nProperly trained and approved, as required, TSO-C145() and TSO-C146() equipped users (WAAS users) with and using approved baro-VNAV equipment  may plan for LNAV/VNAV DA at an alternate airport. Specifically authorized WAAS users with and using approved baro-VNAV equipment may also plan for RNP 0.3 DA at the alternate airport as long as the pilot has verified RNP availability through an approved prediction program.\n\n\nFlying Procedures with WAAS\n\nWAAS receivers support all basic GPS approach functions and provide additional capabilities. One of the major improvements is the ability to generate glide path guidance, independent of ground equipment or barometric aiding. This eliminates several problems such as hot and cold temperature effects, incorrect altimeter setting, or lack of a local altimeter source. It also allows approach procedures to be built without the cost of installing ground stations at each airport or runway. Some approach certified receivers may only generate a glide path with performance similar to Baro-VNAV and are only approved to fly the LNAV/VNAV line of minima on the RNAV (GPS) approach charts. Receivers with additional capability (including faster update rates and smaller integrity limits) are approved to fly the LPV line of minima. The lateral integrity changes dramatically from the 0.3 NM (556 meter) limit for GPS, LNAV, and LNAV/VNAV approach mode, to 40 meters for LPV. It also provides vertical integrity monitoring, which bounds the vertical error to 50 meters for LNAV/VNAV and LPVs with minima of 250' or above, and bounds the vertical error to 35 meters for LPVs with minima below 250'.\n\n\nWhen an approach procedure is selected and active, the receiver will notify the pilot of the most accurate level of service supported by the combination of the WAAS signal, the receiver, and the selected approach, using the naming conventions on the minima lines of the selected approach procedure. For example, if an approach is published with LPV minima and the receiver is only certified for LNAV/VNAV, the equipment would indicate \u201cLNAV/VNAV available,\u201d even though the WAAS signal would support LPV. If flying an existing LNAV/VNAV procedure with no LPV minima, the receiver will notify the pilot \u201cLNAV/VNAV available,\u201d even if the receiver is certified for LPV and the signal supports LPV. If the signal does not support vertical guidance on procedures with LPV and/or LNAV/VNAV minima, the receiver annunciation will read \u201cLNAV available.\u201d On lateral only procedures with LP and LNAV minima the receiver will indicate \u201cLP available\u201d or \u201cLNAV available\u201d based on the level of lateral service available. Once the level of service notification has been given, the receiver will operate in this mode for the duration of the approach procedure, unless that level of service becomes unavailable. The receiver cannot change back to a more accurate level of service until the next time an approach is activated.\n\nNOTE-\nReceivers do not \u201cfail down\u201d to lower levels of service once the approach has been activated. If only the vertical\u2009off flag appears, the pilot may elect to use the LNAV minima if the rules under which the flight is operating allow changing the type of approach being flown after commencing the procedure. If the lateral integrity limit is exceeded on an LP approach, a missed approach will be necessary since there is no way to reset the lateral alarm limit while the approach is active.\n\nAnother additional feature of WAAS receivers is the ability to exclude a bad GPS signal and continue operating normally. This is normally accomplished by the WAAS correction information. Outside WAAS coverage or when WAAS is not available, it is accomplished through a receiver algorithm called FDE. In most cases this operation will be invisible to the pilot since the receiver will continue to operate with other available satellites after excluding the \u201cbad\u201d signal. This capability increases the reliability of navigation.\n\nBoth lateral and vertical scaling for the LNAV/VNAV and LPV approach procedures are different than the linear scaling of basic GPS. When the complete published procedure is flown, \u00b11 NM linear scaling is provided until two (2) NM prior to the FAF, where the sensitivity increases to be similar to the angular scaling of an ILS. There are two\u2009differences in the WAAS scaling and ILS: 1) on long final approach segments, the initial scaling will be \u00b10.3\u2009NM to achieve equivalent performance to GPS (and better than ILS, which is less sensitive far from the runway); 2) close to the runway threshold, the scaling changes to linear instead of continuing to become more sensitive. The width of the final approach course is tailored so that the total width is usually 700 feet at the runway threshold. Since the origin point of the lateral splay for the angular portion of the final is not fixed due to antenna placement like localizer, the splay angle can remain fixed, making a consistent width of final for aircraft being vectored onto the final approach course on different length runways. When the complete published procedure is not flown, and instead the aircraft needs to capture the extended final approach course similar to ILS, the vector to final (VTF) mode is used. Under VTF, the scaling is linear at \u00b11 NM until the point where the ILS angular splay reaches a width of \u00b11 NM regardless of the distance from the FAWP.\n\nThe WAAS scaling is also different than GPS TSO-C129() in the initial portion of the missed approach. Two differences occur here. First, the scaling abruptly changes from the approach scaling to the missed approach scaling, at approximately the departure end of the runway or when the pilot selects missed approach guidance rather than ramping as GPS does. Second, when the first leg of the missed approach is a Track to Fix (TF) leg aligned within 3 degrees of the inbound course, the receiver will change to 0.3 NM linear sensitivity until the turn initiation point for the first waypoint in the missed approach procedure, at which time it will abruptly change to terminal (\u00b11 NM) sensitivity. This allows the elimination of close in obstacles in the early part of the missed approach that may otherwise cause the DA to be raised.\n\nThere are two ways to select the final approach segment of an instrument approach. Most receivers use menus where the pilot selects the airport, the runway, the specific approach procedure and finally the IAF, there is also a channel number selection method. The pilot enters a unique 5-digit number provided on the approach chart, and the receiver recalls the matching final approach segment from the aircraft database. A list of information including the available IAFs is displayed and the pilot selects the appropriate IAF. The pilot should confirm that the correct final approach segment was loaded by cross checking the Approach ID, which is also provided on the approach chart.\n\nThe Along-Track Distance (ATD) during the final approach segment of an LNAV procedure (with a minimum descent altitude) will be to the MAWP. On LNAV/VNAV and LPV approaches to a decision altitude, there is no missed approach waypoint so the along-track distance is displayed to a point normally located at the runway threshold. In most cases, the MAWP for the LNAV approach is located on the runway threshold at the centerline, so these distances will be the same. This distance will always vary slightly from any ILS DME that may be present, since the ILS DME is located further down the runway. Initiation of the missed approach on the LNAV/VNAV and LPV approaches is still based on reaching the decision altitude without any of the items listed in 14 CFR Section 91.175 being visible, and must not be delayed while waiting for the ATD to reach zero. The WAAS receiver, unlike a GPS receiver, will automatically sequence past the MAWP if the missed approach procedure has been designed for RNAV. The pilot may also select missed approach prior to the MAWP; however, navigation will continue to the MAWP prior to waypoint sequencing taking place."

                "section-content": "A GBAS ground installation at an airport can provide localized, differential augmentation to the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal-in-space enabling an aircraft's GLS precision approach capability. Through the GBAS service and the aircraft's GLS installation a pilot may complete an instrument approach offering three-dimensional angular, lateral, and vertical guidance for exact alignment and descent to a runway. The operational benefits of a GLS approach are similar to the benefits of an ILS or LPV approach operation.\n\nNOTE-\nTo remain consistent with international terminology, the FAA will use the term GBAS in place of the former term Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS).\n\n\nAn aircraft's GLS approach capability relies on the broadcast from a GBAS Ground Facility (GGF) installation. The GGF installation includes at least four ground reference stations near the airport's runway(s), a corrections processor, and a VHF Data Broadcast (VDB) uplink antenna. To use the GBAS GGF output and be eligible to conduct a GLS approach, the aircraft requires eligibility to conduct RNP approach (RNP APCH) operations and must meet the additional, specific airworthiness requirements for installation of a GBAS receiver intended to support GLS approach operations. When the aircraft achieves GLS approach eligibility, the aircraft's onboard navigation database may then contain published GLS instrument approach procedures.\n\nDuring a GLS instrument approach procedure, the installation of an aircraft's GLS capability provides the pilot three-dimensional (3D) lateral and vertical navigation guidance much like an ILS instrument approach. GBAS corrections augment the GPS signal-in-space by offering position corrections, ensures the availability of enhanced integrity parameters, and then transmits the actual approach path definition over the VDB uplink antenna. A single GBAS ground station can support multiple GLS approaches to one or more runways.\n\nThrough the GBAS ground station, a GLS approach offers a unique operational service volume distinct from the traditional ILS approach service volume (see FIG 1-1-9). However, despite the unique service volume, in the final approach segment, a GLS approach provides precise 3D angular lateral and vertical guidance mimicking the precision guidance of an ILS approach.\n\nTransitions to and segments of the published GLS instrument approach procedures may rely on use of RNAV 1 or RNP 1 prior to an IAF. Then, during the approach procedure, prior to the aircraft entering the GLS approach mode, a GLS approach procedure design uses the RNP APCH procedure design criteria to construct the procedural path (the criteria used to publish procedures titled \u201cRNAV (GPS)\u201d in the US). Thus, a GLS approach procedure may include paths requiring turns after the aircraft crosses the IAF, prior to the aircraft's flight guidance entering the GLS approach flight guidance mode. Likewise, the missed approach procedure for a GLS approach procedure relies exclusively on the same missed approach criteria supporting an RNP APCH.\n\nWhen maneuvering the aircraft in compliance with an ATC clearance to intercept a GLS approach prior to the final approach segment (e.g. \u201cbeing vectored\u201d), the pilot should adhere to the clearance and ensure the aircraft intercepts the extended GLS final approach course within the specified service volume. Once on the GLS final approach course, the pilot should ensure the aircraft is in the GLS approach mode prior to reaching the procedure's glidepath intercept point. Once the aircraft is in the GLS flight guidance mode and captures the GLS glidepath, the pilot should fly the GLS final approach segment using the same pilot techniques they use to fly an ILS final approach or the final approach of an RNAV (GPS) approach flown to LPV minimums. See also the Instrument Procedures Handbook for more information on how to conduct a GLS instrument approach procedure.\nFIG 1-1-9GLS Standard Approach Service Volume"

                "section-content": "It is virtually impossible to provide regulations and procedures applicable to all possible situations associated with two\u2010way radio communications failure. During two\u2010way radio communications failure, when confronted by a situation not covered in the regulation, pilots are expected to exercise good judgment in whatever action they elect to take. Should the situation so dictate they should not be reluctant to use the emergency action contained in 14\u2009CFR Section 91.3(b).\n\n\nWhether two\u2010way communications failure constitutes an emergency depends on the circumstances, and in any event, it is a determination made by the pilot. 14\u2009CFR Section 91.3(b) authorizes a pilot to deviate from any rule in Subparts A and B to the extent required to meet an emergency.\n\nIn the event of two\u2010way radio communications failure, ATC service will be provided on the basis that the pilot is operating in accordance with 14\u2009CFR Section 91.185. A pilot experiencing two\u2010way communications failure should (unless emergency authority is exercised) comply with 14\u2009CFR Section\u200991.185 quoted below:\n\nGeneral. Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, each pilot who has two\u2010way radio communications failure when operating under IFR must comply with the rules of this section.\n\n\nVFR conditions. If the failure occurs in VFR conditions, or if VFR conditions are encountered after the failure, each pilot must continue the flight under VFR and land as soon as practicable.\n\nNOTE-\nThis procedure also applies when two\u2010way radio failure occurs while operating in Class A airspace. The primary objective of this provision in 14\u2009CFR Section\u200991.185 is to preclude extended IFR operation by these aircraft within the ATC system. Pilots should recognize that operation under these conditions may unnecessarily as well as adversely affect other users of the airspace, since ATC may be required to reroute or delay other users in order to protect the failure aircraft. However, it is not intended that the requirement to \u201cland as soon as practicable\u201d be construed to mean \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Pilots retain the prerogative of exercising their best judgment and are not required to land at an unauthorized airport, at an airport unsuitable for the type of aircraft flown, or to land only minutes short of their intended destination.\n\nIFR conditions. If the failure occurs in IFR conditions, or if subparagraph 2 above cannot be complied with, each pilot must continue the flight according to the following:\n\nRoute.\n\nBy the route assigned in the last ATC clearance received;\n\n\nIf being radar vectored, by the direct route from the point of radio failure to the fix, route, or airway specified in the vector clearance;\n\nIn the absence of an assigned route, by the route that ATC has advised may be expected in a further clearance; or\n\nIn the absence of an assigned route or a route that ATC has advised may be expected in a further clearance by the route filed in the flight plan.\n\n\nAltitude. At the HIGHEST of the following altitudes or flight levels FOR THE ROUTE SEGMENT BEING FLOWN:\n\nThe altitude or flight level assigned in the last ATC clearance received;\n\n\nThe minimum altitude (converted, if appropriate, to minimum flight level as prescribed in 14\u2009CFR Section\u200991.121(c)) for IFR operations; or\n\nThe altitude or flight level ATC has advised may be expected in a further clearance.\n\nNOTE-\nThe intent of the rule is that a pilot who has experienced two\u2010way radio failure should select the appropriate altitude for the particular route segment being flown and make the necessary altitude adjustments for subsequent route segments. If the pilot received an \u201cexpect further clearance\u201d containing a higher altitude to expect at a specified time or fix, maintain the highest of the following altitudes until that time/fix:\n\t(1)\u2009 the last assigned altitude; or \n\t(2) the minimum altitude/flight level for IFR operations.\nUpon reaching the time/fix specified, the pilot should commence climbing to the altitude advised to expect. If the radio failure occurs after the time/fix specified, the altitude to be expected is not applicable and the pilot should maintain an altitude consistent with 1 or 2 above. If the pilot receives an \u201cexpect further clearance\u201d containing a lower altitude, the pilot should maintain the highest of 1 or 2 above until that time/fix specified in subparagraph (c) Leave clearance limit, below.\n\nEXAMPLE-A pilot experiencing two\u2010way radio failure at an assigned altitude of 7,000 feet is cleared along a direct route which will require a climb to a minimum IFR altitude of 9,000 feet, should climb to reach 9,000 feet at the time or place where it becomes necessary (see 14 CFR Section\u200991.177(b)). Later while proceeding along an airway with an MEA of 5,000 feet, the pilot would descend to 7,000 feet (the last assigned altitude), because that altitude is higher than the MEA.A pilot experiencing two\u2010way radio failure while being progressively descended to lower altitudes to begin an approach is assigned 2,700 feet until crossing the VOR and then cleared for the approach. The MOCA along the airway is 2,700 feet and MEA is 4,000 feet. The aircraft is within 22 NM of the VOR. The pilot should remain at 2,700 feet until crossing the VOR because that altitude is the minimum IFR altitude for the route segment being flown.The MEA between a and b: 5,000 feet. The MEA between b and c: 5,000 feet. The MEA between c and d: 11,000 feet. The MEA between d and e: 7,000 feet. A pilot had been cleared via a, b, c, d, to e. While flying between a and b the assigned altitude was 6,000 feet and the pilot was told to expect a clearance to 8,000 feet at b. Prior to receiving the higher altitude assignment, the pilot experienced two\u2010way failure. The pilot would maintain 6,000 to b, then climb to 8,000 feet (the altitude advised to expect). The pilot would maintain 8,000 feet, then climb to 11,000 at c, or prior to c if necessary to comply with an MCA at c. (14 CFR Section\u200991.177(b).) Upon reaching d, the pilot would descend to 8,000 feet (even though the MEA was 7,000 feet), as 8,000 was the highest of the altitude situations stated in the rule (14 CFR Section\u200991.185).\nLeave clearance limit.\n\nWhen the clearance limit is a fix from which an approach begins, commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the expect further clearance time if one has been received, or if one has not been received, as close as possible to the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) as calculated from the filed or amended (with ATC) Estimated Time En Route (ETE).\n\n\nIf the clearance limit is not a fix from which an approach begins, leave the clearance limit at the expect further clearance time if one has been received, or if none has been received, upon arrival over the clearance limit, and proceed to a fix from which an approach begins and commence descent or descent and approach as close as possible to the estimated time of arrival as calculated from the filed or amended (with ATC) estimated time en route."

Ducks and geese are frequently observed up to 7,000 feet AGL and pilots are cautioned to minimize en route flying at lower altitudes during migration.\n\nConsidered the greatest potential hazard to aircraft because of their size, abundance, or habit of flying in dense flocks are gulls, waterfowl, vultures, hawks, owls, egrets, blackbirds, and starlings. Four\u2009major migratory flyways exist in the U.S. The Atlantic flyway parallels the Atlantic Coast. The Mississippi Flyway stretches from Canada through the Great Lakes and follows the Mississippi River. The Central Flyway represents a broad area east of the Rockies, stretching from Canada through Central America. The Pacific Flyway follows the west coast and overflies major parts of Washington, Oregon, and California.

(See Instrument Flying Handbook.) Scale error may be observed while performing a ground altimeter check using the following procedure:\n\nSet the current reported airfield altimeter setting on the altimeter setting scale.\n\n\nRead the altitude on the altimeter. The altitude should read the known field elevation if you are located on the same reference level used to establish the altimeter setting.\n\nIf the difference from the known field elevation and the altitude read from the altimeter is plus or minus 75 feet or greater, the accuracy of the altimeter is questionable and the problem should be referred to an appropriately rated repair station for evaluation and possible correction.\n\n\nIt is important to set the current altimeter settings for the area of operation when flying at an enroute altitude that does not require a standard altimeter setting of 29.92 \u201cHg. If the altimeter is not set to the current altimeter setting when flying from an area of high pressure into an area of low pressure, the aircraft will be closer to the surface than the altimeter indicates. An inch Hg. error in the altimeter setting equals 1,000 feet of altitude. For example, setting 29.90 \u201cHg instead of 30.90 \u201cHg. To quote an old saying: \u201cGOING FROM A HIGH TO A LOW, LOOK OUT BELOW.\u201d\n\nThe aircraft cruising altitude or flight level is maintained by referencing the barometric altimeter. Procedures for setting altimeters during high and low barometric pressure events must be set using the following procedures:\n\nBelow 18,000 feet mean sea level (MSL).\n\nBarometric pressure is 31.00 \u201cHg or less.\n\nSet the altimeter to a current reported altimeter setting from a station along the route and within 100 NM of the aircraft, or;\n\n\nIf there is no station within this area, use the current reported altimeter setting of an appropriate available station, or;\n\nNOTE-\nAir traffic controllers will furnish this information at least once when en route or on an instrument flight plan within their controlled airspace:\n\nIf the aircraft is not equipped with a radio, set the altimeter to the elevation of the departure airport or use an available appropriate altimeter setting prior to departure.\n\n\nWhen the barometric pressure exceeds 31.00 \u201cHg., a NOTAM will be published to define the affected geographic area. The NOTAM will also institute the following procedures:\n\nAll aircraft: All aircraft will set 31.00 \u201cHg. for en route operations below 18,000 feet MSL. Maintain this setting until out of the affected area or until reaching the beginning of the final approach segment on an instrument approach. Set the current altimeter setting (above 31.00 \u201cHg.) approaching the final segment, if possible. If no current altimeter setting is available, or if a setting above 31.00 \u201cHg. cannot be made on the aircraft's altimeter, leave 31.00 \u201cHg. set in the altimeter and continue the approach.\n\n\n Set 31.00 \u201cHg. in the altimeter prior to reaching the lowest of any mandatory/crossing altitudes or 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL) when on a departure or missed approach.\n\nNOTE-\nAir traffic control will issue actual altimeter settings and advise pilots to set 31.00 \u201cHg. in their altimeters for en route operations below 18,000 feet MSL in affected areas.\n\nNo additional restrictions apply for aircraft operating into an airport that are able to set and measure altimeter settings above 31.00 \u201cHg.\n\nFlight operations are restricted to VFR weather conditions to and from an airport that is unable to accurately measure barometric pressures above 31.00 \u201cHg. These airports will report the barometric pressure as \u201cmissing\u201d or \u201cin excess of 31.00 \u201cHg.\u201d.\n\nVFR aircraft. VFR operating aircraft have no additional restrictions. Pilots must use caution when flight planning and operating in these conditions.\n\nIFR aircraft: IFR aircraft unable to set an altimeter setting above 31.00 \u201cHg. should apply the following:\n\nThe suitability of departure alternate airports, destination airports, and destination alternate airports will be determined by increasing the published ceiling and visibility requirements when unable to set the aircraft altimeter above 31.00 \u201cHg. Any reported or forecast altimeter setting over 31.00 \u201cHg. will be rounded up to the next tenth to calculate the required increases. The ceiling will be increased by 100 feet and the visibility by 1/4 statute mile for each 1/10 \u201cHg. over 31.00 \u201cHg. Use these adjusted values in accordance with operating regulations and operations specifications.\n\nEXAMPLE-\nDestination airport altimeter is 31.21 \u201cHg. The planned approach is an instrument landing system (ILS) with a decision altitude (DA) 200 feet and visibility 1/2 mile (200-1/2). Subtract 31.00 \u201cHg. from 31.21 \u201cHg. to get .21 \u201cHg. .21 \u201cHg rounds up to .30 \u201cHg. Calculate the increased requirement: 100 feet per 1/10 equates to a 300 feet increase for .30 \u201cHg. 1/4 statute mile per 1/10 equates to a 3/4 statute mile increase for .30 \u201cHg. The destination weather requirement is determined by adding the 300-3/4 increase to 200-1/2. The destination weather requirement is now 500-1 \u00bc..\n\n31.00 \u201cHg. will remain set during the complete instrument approach. The aircraft has arrived at the DA or minimum descent altitude (MDA) when the published DA or MDA is displayed on the barometric altimeter.\n\nNOTE-\nThe aircraft will be approximately 300 feet higher than the indicated barometric altitude using this method.\n\nThese restrictions do not apply to authorized Category II/III ILS operations and certificate holders using approved atmospheric pressure at aerodrome elevation (QFE) altimetry systems.\n\nThe FAA Flight Procedures & Airspace Group, Flight Technologies and Procedures Division may authorize temporary waivers to permit emergency resupply or emergency medical service operation.\n\n\nAt or above 18,000 feet MSL. All operators will set 29.92 \u201cHg. (standard setting) in the barometric altimeter. The lowest usable flight level is determined by the atmospheric pressure in the area of operation as shown in  TBL 7-2-1.

A drone crash or malfunction, irrespective of which flight rules govern the flight, may trigger a reporting requirement to either the FAA, the NTSB, or both. The NTSB reporting requirements listed in 49 CFR 830.5, Immediate Notification, are separate and distinct from the FAA reporting requirements. All UAS flyers operating in the NAS recreational, civil, and public are encouraged to read and follow NTSB reporting requirements should they experience a crash or malfunction that meets NTSB criteria and triggers NTSB reporting. See NTSB Reporting Requirements and subparagraph 11-8-4b. COAs issued to Part 91 civil and public operators will contain specific incident/accident reporting requirements for the operator.\n\nPart 107 Operations. Part 107 operators have a reporting requirement described in 14 CFR Section 107.9, Accident Reporting. A remote pilot-in-command is required to report any sUAS crash that causes serious injury or loss of consciousness, or property damage other than to the UAS of over $500. Property damage refers to any property that is not part of the UA System or attached to the UAS.\n\n\nRecreational Flyer Operations. Recreational flyers fully complying with the exception listed in 49 USC 44809 are not required to report crashes to the FAA. However, this does not alleviate the recreational flyer from the requirement to report the crash to the NTSB if the crash meets the NTSB reporting requirements.\n\nPart 91 Operations. Part 91 operators typically flown by public aircraft operators, civil aircraft operators, or civil operators flying FAA type certificated UAS have unique reporting requirements delineated in the terms and conditions of their certificate of waiver/authorization and must comply with those specific requirements.\n\n\nNTSB Reporting Requirements. The NTSB defines a UAS accident as an occurrence associated with the operations of any public or civil UAS that takes place between the time that the system is activated with the purpose of flight and the time that the system is deactivated at the conclusion of its mission, in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or the UAS holds an airworthiness certificate and sustains substantial damage. In the case of a midair collision involving a UAS, any midair collision must be reported.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\n14 CFR Section 830.5, Immediate Notification.\n14 CFR Section 107.9, Accident Reporting."

                "section-title": "Offshore Helicopter Operations",
                "section-content": "Introduction\nThe offshore environment offers unique applications and challenges for helicopter pilots. The mission demands, the nature of oil and gas exploration and production facilities, and the flight environment (weather, terrain, obstacles, traffic), demand special practices, techniques and procedures not found in other flight operations. Several industry organizations have risen to the task of reducing risks\u2009in offshore operations, including the Helicopter\u2009Safety Advisory Conference (HSAC) (http://www.hsac.org), and the Offshore Committee of the Helicopter Association International (HAI) (https://rotor.org/). The following recommended practices for offshore helicopter operations are based on guidance developed by HSAC for use in the Gulf of Mexico, and provided here with their permission. While not regulatory, these recommended practices provide aviation and oil and gas industry operators with useful information in developing procedures to avoid certain hazards of offshore helicopter operations.\nNOTE-\nLike all aviation practices, these recommended practices are under constant review. In addition to normal procedures for comments, suggested changes, or corrections to the AIM (contained in the Preface), any questions or feedback concerning these recommended procedures may also be directed to the HSAC through the feedback feature of the HSAC website (http://www.hsac.org).\n\n\nPassenger Management on and about Heliport Facilities\n\nBackground. Several incidents involving offshore helicopter passengers have highlighted the potential for incidents and accidents on and about the heliport area. The following practices will minimize risks to passengers and others involved in heliport operations.\n\n\nRecommended Practices\n\nHeliport facilities should have a designated and posted passenger waiting area which is clear of the heliport, heliport access points, and stairways.\n\n\nArriving passengers and cargo should be unloaded and cleared from the heliport and access route prior to loading departing passengers and cargo.\n\nWhere a flight crew consists of more than one pilot, one crewmember should supervise the unloading/loading process from outside the aircraft.\n\nWhere practical, a designated facility employee should assist with loading/unloading, etc.\n\nCrane-Helicopter Operational Procedures\n\nBackground. Historical experience has shown that catastrophic consequences can occur when industry safe practices for crane/helicopter operations are not observed. The following recommended practices are designed to minimize risks during crane and helicopter operations.\n\n\nRecommended Practices\n\nPersonnel awareness\n\nCrane operators and pilots should develop a mutual understanding and respect of the others' operational limitations and cooperate in the spirit of safety;\n\n\nPilots need to be aware that crane operators sometimes cannot release the load to cradle the crane boom, such as when attached to wire line lubricators or supporting diving bells; and\n\nCrane operators need to be aware that helicopters require warm up before takeoff, a two-minute cool down before shutdown, and cannot circle for extended lengths of time because of fuel consumption.\n\n\nIt is recommended that when helicopters are approaching,  maneuvering, taking off, or running on the heliport, cranes be shutdown and the operator leave the cab. Cranes not in use must have their booms cradled, if feasible. If in use, the crane's boom(s) are to be pointed away from the heliport and the crane shutdown for helicopter operations.\n\nPilots will not approach, land on, takeoff, or have rotor blades turning on heliports of structures not complying with the above practice.\n\nIt is recommended that cranes on offshore platforms, rigs, vessels, or any other facility, which could interfere with helicopter operations (including approach/departure paths):\n\nBe equipped with a red rotating beacon or red high intensity strobe light connected to the system powering the crane, indicating the crane is under power;\n\n\nBe designed to allow the operator a maximum view of the helideck area and should be equipped with wide-angle mirrors to eliminate blind spots; and\n\nHave their boom tips, headache balls, and hooks painted with high visibility international orange.\n\nHelicopter/Tanker Operations\n\nBackground. The interface of helicopters and tankers during shipboard helicopter operations is complex and may be hazardous unless appropriate procedures are coordinated among all parties. The following recommended practices are designed to minimize risks during helicopter/tanker operations:\n\n\nRecommended Practices\n\nManagement, flight operations personnel, and pilots should be familiar with and apply the operating safety standards set forth in \u201cGuide to Helicopter/Ship Operations\u201d, International Chamber of Shipping, Third Edition, 5-89 (as amended), establishing operational guidelines/standards and safe practices sufficient to safeguard helicopter/tanker operations.\n\n\nAppropriate plans, approvals, and communications must be accomplished prior to reaching the vessel, allowing tanker crews sufficient time to perform required safety preparations and position  crew members to receive or dispatch a helicopter safely.\n\nAppropriate approvals and direct communications with the bridge of the tanker must be maintained throughout all helicopter/tanker operations.\n\nHelicopter/tanker operations, including landings/departures, must not be conducted until the helicopter pilot-in-command has received and acknowledged permission from the bridge of the tanker.\n\nHelicopter/tanker operations must not be conducted during product/cargo transfer.\n\nGenerally, permission will not be granted to land on tankers during mooring operations or while maneuvering alongside another tanker.\n\nHelideck/Heliport Operational Hazard Warning(s) Procedures\n\nBackground\n\nA number of operational hazards can develop on or near offshore helidecks or onshore heliports that can be minimized through procedures for proper notification or visual warning to pilots. Examples of hazards include but are not limited to:\n\nPerforating operations: subparagraph\u2009f.\n\n\nH2S gas presence: subparagraph g.\n\nGas venting: subparagraph h; or,\n\nClosed helidecks or heliports: subparagraph i (unspecified cause).\n\n\nThese and other operational hazards are currently minimized through timely dissemination of a written Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) for pilots by helicopter companies and operators. A NOTAM provides a written description of the hazard, time and duration of occurrence, and other pertinent information. ANY POTENTIAL HAZARD should be communicated to helicopter operators or company aviation departments as early as possible to allow the NOTAM to be activated.\n\nTo supplement the existing NOTAM procedure and further assist in reducing these hazards, a standardized visual signal(s) on the helideck/heliport will provide a positive indication to an approaching helicopter of the status of the landing area. Recommended Practice(s) have been developed to reinforce the NOTAM procedures and standardize visual signals.\n\n\nDrilling Rig Perforating Operations: Helideck/Heliport Operational Hazard Warning(s)/Procedure(s)\n\nBackground. A critical step in the oil well completion process is perforation, which involves the use of explosive charges in the drill pipe to open the pipe to oil or gas deposits. Explosive charges used in conjunction with perforation operations offshore can potentially be prematurely detonated by radio transmissions, including those from helicopters. The following practices are recommended.\n\n\nRecommended Practices\n\nPersonnel Conducting Perforating Operations. Whenever perforating operations are scheduled and operators are concerned that radio transmissions from helicopters in the vicinity may jeopardize the operation, personnel conducting perforating operations should take the following precautionary measures:\n\nNotify company aviation departments, helicopter operators or bases, and nearby manned platforms of the pending perforation operation so the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system can be activated for the perforation operation and the temporary helideck closure.\n\n\nClose the deck and make the radio warning clearly visible to passing pilots, install a temporary marking (described in subparagraph\u200910-2-1i1(b)) with the words \u201cNO RADIO\u201d stenciled in red on the legs of the diagonals. The letters should be 24 inches high and 12 inches wide. (See FIG 10-2-1.)\n\nThe marker should be installed during the time that charges may be affected by radio transmissions.\n\n\nPilots\n\nWhen operating within 1,000 feet of a known perforation operation or observing the white X with red \u201cNO RADIO\u201d warning indicating perforation operations are underway, pilots will avoid radio transmissions from or near the helideck (within 1,000\u2009feet) and will not land on the deck if the X is present. In addition to communications radios, radio transmissions are also emitted by aircraft radar, transponders, ADS-B equipment, radar altimeters, and DME equipment, and ELTs.\n\n\nWhenever possible, make radio calls to the platform being approached or to the Flight Following Communications Center at least one mile out on approach. Ensure all communications are complete outside the 1,000 foot hazard distance. If no response is received, or if the platform is not radio equipped, further radio transmissions should not be made until visual contact with the deck indicates it is open for operation (no white \u201cX\u201d).\n\nHydrogen Sulfide Gas Helideck/Heliport Operational Hazard Warning(s)/Procedures\n\nBackground. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas: Hydrogen sulfide gas in higher concentrations (300-500 ppm) can cause loss of consciousness within a few seconds and presents a hazard to pilots on/near offshore helidecks. When operating in offshore areas that have been identified to have concentrations of hydrogen sulfide gas, the following practices are recommended.\n\n\nRecommended Practices\n\nPilots\n\nEnsure approved protective air packs are available for emergency use by the crew on the helicopter.\n\n\nIf shutdown on a helideck, request the supervisor in charge provide a briefing on location of protective equipment and safety procedures.\n\nIf while flying near a helideck and the visual red beacon alarm is observed or an unusually strong odor of \u201crotten eggs\u201d is detected, immediately don the protective air pack, exit to an area upwind, and notify the suspected source field of the hazard.\nFIG 10-2-1Closed Helideck Marking - No Radio\n\n\nOil Field Supervisors\n\nIf presence of hydrogen sulfide is detected, a red rotating beacon or red high intensity strobe light adjacent to the primary helideck stairwell or wind indicator on the structure should be turned on to provide visual warning of hazard. If the beacon is to be located near the stairwell, the State of Louisiana \u201cOffshore Heliport Design Guide\u201d and FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 150/5390-2A, Heliport Design Guide, should be reviewed to ensure proper clearance on the helideck.\n\n\nNotify nearby helicopter operators and bases of the hazard and advise when hazard is cleared.\n\nProvide a safety briefing to include location of protective equipment to all arriving personnel.\n\nWind socks or indicator should be clearly visible to provide upwind indication for the pilot.\n\nGas Venting Helideck/Heliport Operational Hazard Warning(s)/Procedures - Operations Near Gas Vent Booms\n\nBackground. Ignited flare booms can release a large volume of natural gas and create a hot fire and intense heat with little time for the pilot to react. Likewise, unignited gas vents can release reasonably large volumes of methane gas under certain conditions. Thus, operations conducted very near unignited gas vents require precautions to prevent inadvertent ingestion of combustible gases by the helicopter engine(s). The following practices are recommended.\n\n\nPilots\n\nGas will drift upwards and downwind of the vent. Plan the approach and takeoff to observe and avoid the area downwind of the vent, remaining as far away as practicable from the open end of the vent boom.\n\n\nDo not attempt to start or land on an offshore helideck when the deck is downwind of a gas vent unless properly trained personnel verify conditions are safe.\n\nOil Field Supervisors\n\nDuring venting of large amounts of unignited raw gas, a red rotating beacon or red high intensity strobe light adjacent to the primary helideck stairwell or wind indicator should be turned on to provide visible warning of hazard. If the beacon is to be located near the stairwell, the State of Louisiana \u201cOffshore Heliport Design Guide\u201d and FAA AC\u2009150/5390-2A, Heliport Design Guide, should be reviewed to ensure proper clearance from the helideck.\n\n\nNotify nearby helicopter operators and bases of the hazard for planned operations.\n\nWind socks or indicator should be clearly visible to provide upward indication for the pilot.\n\nHelideck/Heliport Operational Warning(s)/Procedure(s) - Closed Helidecks or Heliports\n\nBackground. A white \u201cX\u201d marked diagonally from corner to corner across a helideck or heliport touchdown area is the universally accepted visual indicator that the landing area is closed for safety of other reasons and that helicopter operations are not permitted. The following practices are recommended.\n\nPermanent Closing. If a helideck or heliport is to be permanently closed, X diagonals of the same size and location as indicated above should be used, but the markings should be painted on the landing area.\n\nNOTE-\nWhite Decks: If a helideck is painted white, then international orange or yellow markings can be used for the temporary or permanent diagonals.\n\n\nTemporary Closing. A temporary marker can be used for hazards of an interim nature. This marker could be made from vinyl or other durable material in the shape of a diagonal \u201cX.\u201d The marker should be white with legs at least 20 feet long and 3 feet in width. This marker is designed to be quickly secured and removed from the deck using grommets and rope ties. The duration, time, location, and nature of these temporary closings should be provided to and coordinated with company aviation departments, nearby helicopter bases, and helicopter operators supporting the area. These markers MUST be removed when the hazard no longer exists. (See FIG 10-2-2.)\nFIG 10-2-2Closed Helideck Marking\n\n\nOffshore (VFR) Operating Altitudes for Helicopters\n\nBackground. Mid-air collisions constitute a significant percentage of total fatal offshore helicopter accidents. A method of reducing this risk is the use of coordinated VFR cruising altitudes. To enhance safety through standardized vertical separation of helicopters when flying in the offshore environment, it is recommended that helicopter operators flying in a particular area establish a cooperatively developed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for VFR operating altitudes. An example of such an SOP is contained in this example.\n\n\nRecommended Practice Example\n\nField Operations. Without compromising minimum safe operating altitudes, helicopters working within an offshore field \u201cconstituting a cluster\u201d should use altitudes not to exceed 500 feet.\n\n\nEn Route Operations\n\nHelicopters operating below 750' AGL should avoid transitioning through offshore fields.\n\n\nHelicopters en route to and from offshore locations, below 3,000 feet, weather permitting, should use en route altitudes as outlined in TBL 10-2-1.\nTBL 10-2-1\n\n\n\nMagnetic Heading\n\n\nAltitude\n\n\n\n\n0\u00b0 to 179\u00b0\n\n\n750'\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1750'\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2750'\n\n\n\n\n180\u00b0 to 359\u00b0\n\n\n1250'\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n2250'\n\n\n\nArea Agreements. See HSAC Area Agreement Maps for operating procedures for onshore high density traffic locations.\n\nNOTE-\nPilots of helicopters operating VFR above 3,000 feet above the surface should refer to the current Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 91), and paragraph\u20093-1-4, Basic VFR Weather Minimums, of the AIM.\n\nLanding Lights. Aircraft landing lights should be on to enhance aircraft identification:\n\nDuring takeoff and landings;\n\n\nIn congested helicopter or fixed wing traffic areas;\n\nDuring reduced visibility; or,\n\nAnytime safety could be enhanced.\n\nOffshore Helidecks/Landing Communications\n\nBackground. To enhance safety, and provide appropriate time to prepare for helicopter operations, the following is recommended when anticipating a landing on an offshore helideck.\n\n\nRecommended Practices\n\nBefore landing on an offshore helideck, pilots are encouraged to establish communications with the company owning or operating the helideck if frequencies exist for that purpose.\n\n\nWhen impracticable, or if frequencies do not exist, pilots or operations personnel should attempt to contact the company owning or operating the helideck by telephone. Contact should be made before the pilot departs home base/point of departure to advise of intentions and obtain landing permission if necessary.\n\nNOTE-\nIt is recommended that communications be established a minimum of 10 minutes prior to planned arrival time. This practice may be a requirement of some offshore owner/operators.\n\nNOTE-\nSee subparagraph 10-2-1d for Tanker Operations.Private use Heliport. Offshore heliports are privately owned/operated facilities and their use is limited to persons having prior authorization to utilize the facility.\n\nTwo (2) Helicopter Operations on Offshore Helidecks\n\nBackground. Standardized procedures can enhance the safety of operating a second helicopter on an offshore helideck, enabling pilots to determine/maintain minimum operational parameters. Orientation of the parked helicopter on the helideck, wind and other factors may prohibit multi-helicopter operations. More conservative Rotor Diameter (RD) clearances may be required under differing condition, i.e., temperature, wet deck, wind (velocity/direction/gusts), obstacles, approach/departure angles, etc. Operations are at the pilot's discretion.\n\n\nRecommended Practice. Helideck size, structural weight capability, and type of main rotor on the parked and operating helicopter will aid in determining accessibility by a second helicopter. Pilots should determine that multi-helicopter deck operations are permitted by the helideck owner/operator.\n\nRecommended Criteria\n\nMinimum one-third rotor diameter clearance (1/3 RD). The landing helicopter maintains a minimum 1/3 RD clearance between the tips of its turning rotor and the closest part of a parked and secured helicopter (rotors stopped and tied down).\n\n\nThree foot parking distance from deck edge (3'). Helicopters operating on an offshore helideck land or park the helicopter with a skid/wheel assembly no closer than 3 feet from helideck edge.\n\nTiedowns. Main rotors on all helicopters that are shut down be properly secured (tied down) to prevent the rotor blades from turning.\n\nMedium (transport) and larger helicopters should not land on any offshore helideck where a light helicopter is parked unless the light helicopter is property secured to the helideck and has main rotor tied down.\n\nHelideck owners/operators should ensure that the helideck has a serviceable anti-skid surface.\n\nWeight and limitations markings on helideck. The helideck weight limitations should be displayed by markings visible to the pilot (see State of Louisiana \u201cOffshore Heliport Design Guide\u201d and FAA AC 150/5390-2A, Heliport Design Guide).\n\nNOTE-\nSome offshore helideck owners/operators have restrictions on the number of helicopters allowed on a helideck. When helideck size permits, multiple (more than two) helicopter operations are permitted by some operators.\n\nHelicopter Rapid Refueling Procedures (HRR)\n\nBackground. Helicopter Rapid Refueling (HRR), engine(s)/rotors operating, can be conducted safely when utilizing trained personnel and observing safe practices. This recommended practice provides minimum guidance for HRR as outlined in National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and industry practices. For detailed guidance, please refer to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Document  407, \u201cStandard for Aircraft Fuel Servicing,\u201d 1990 edition, including 1993 HRR Amendment.\n\nNOTE-\nCertain operators prohibit HRR, or \u201chot refueling,\u201d or may have specific procedures for certain aircraft or refueling locations. See the General Operations Manual and/or Operations Specifications to determine the applicable procedures or limitations.\n\n\nRecommended Practices\n\nOnly turbine-engine helicopters fueled with JET A or JET A-1 with fueling ports located below any engine exhausts may be fueled while an onboard engine(s) is (are) operating.\n\n\nHelicopter fueling while an onboard engine(s) is (are) operating should only be conducted under the following conditions:\n\nA properly certificated and current pilot is at the controls and a trained refueler attending the fuel nozzle during the entire fuel servicing process. The pilot monitors the fuel quantity and signals the refueler when quantity is reached.\n\n\nNo electrical storms (thunderstorms) are present within 10 nautical miles. Lightning can travel great distances beyond the actual thunderstorm.\n\nPassengers disembark the helicopter and move to a safe location prior to HRR operations. When the pilot-in-command deems it necessary for passenger safety that they remain onboard, passengers should be briefed on the evacuation route to follow to clear the area.\n\nPassengers not board or disembark during HRR operations nor should cargo be loaded or unloaded.\n\nOnly designated personnel, trained in HRR operations should conduct HRR written authorization to include safe handling of the fuel and equipment.

                "section-content": "Effect of Lighting on Seeing Conditions in Night VFR Helicopter Operations\n\nNOTE-\nThis guidance was developed to support safe night VFR helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) operations. The principles of lighting and seeing conditions are useful in any night VFR operation.\nWhile ceiling and visibility significantly affect safety in night VFR operations, lighting conditions also have a profound effect on safety. Even in conditions in which visibility and ceiling are determined to be visual meteorological conditions, the ability to discern unlighted or low contrast objects and terrain at night may be compromised. The ability to discern these objects and terrain is the seeing condition, and is related to the amount of natural and man made lighting available, and the contrast, reflectivity, and texture of surface terrain and obstruction features. In order to conduct operations safely, seeing conditions must be accounted for in the planning and execution of night VFR operations.\nNight VFR seeing conditions can be described by identifying \u201chigh lighting conditions\u201d and \u201clow lighting conditions.\u201d\n\nHigh lighting conditions exist when one of two sets of conditions are present:\n\nThe sky cover is less than broken (less than 5/8 cloud cover), the time is between the local Moon rise and Moon set, and the lunar disk is at least 50% illuminated; or\n\n\nThe aircraft is operated over surface lighting which, at least, provides for the lighting of prominent obstacles, the identification of terrain features (shorelines, valleys, hills, mountains, slopes) and a horizontal reference by which the pilot may control the helicopter. For example, this surface lighting may be the result of:\n\nExtensive cultural lighting (man-made, such as a built-up area of a city),\n\n\nSignificant reflected cultural lighting (such as the illumination caused by the reflection of a major metropolitan area's lighting reflecting off a cloud ceiling), or\n\nLimited cultural lighting combined with a high level of natural reflectivity of celestial illumination, such as that provided by a surface covered by snow or a desert surface.\n\n\nLow lighting conditions are those that do not meet the high lighting conditions requirements.\n\nSome areas may be considered a high lighting environment only in specific circumstances. For example, some surfaces, such as a forest with limited cultural lighting, normally have little reflectivity, requiring dependence on significant moonlight to achieve a high lighting condition. However, when that same forest is covered with snow, its reflectivity may support a high lighting condition based only on starlight. Similarly, a desolate area, with little cultural lighting, such as a desert, may have such inherent natural reflectivity that it may be considered a high lighting conditions area regardless of season, provided the cloud cover does not prevent starlight from being reflected from the surface. Other surfaces, such as areas of open water, may never have enough reflectivity or cultural lighting to ever be characterized as a high lighting area.\n\nThrough the accumulation of night flying experience in a particular area, the operator will develop the ability to determine, prior to departure, which areas can be considered supporting high or low lighting conditions. Without that operational experience, low lighting considerations should be applied by operators for both pre-flight planning and operations until high lighting conditions are observed or determined to be regularly available.\n\n\nAstronomical Definitions and Background Information for Night Operations\n\nDefinitions\n\nHorizon. Wherever one is located on or near the Earth's surface, the Earth is perceived as essentially flat and, therefore, as a plane. If there are no visual obstructions, the apparent intersection of the sky with the Earth's (plane) surface is the horizon, which appears as a circle centered at the observer. For rise/set computations, the observer's eye is considered to be on the surface of the Earth, so that the horizon is geometrically exactly 90 degrees from the local vertical direction.\n\n\nRise, Set. During the course of a day the Earth rotates once on its axis causing the phenomena of rising and setting. All celestial bodies, the Sun, Moon, stars and planets, seem to appear in the sky at the horizon to the East of any particular place, then to cross the sky and again disappear at the horizon to the West. Because the Sun and Moon appear as circular disks and not as points of light, a definition of rise or set must be very specific, because not all of either body is seen to rise or set at once.\n\nSunrise and sunset refer to the times when the upper edge of the disk of the Sun is on the horizon, considered unobstructed relative to the location of interest. Atmospheric conditions are assumed to be average, and the location is in a level region on the Earth's surface.\n\nMoonrise and moonset times are computed for exactly the same circumstances as for sunrise and sunset. However, moonrise and moonset may occur at any time during a 24 hour period and, consequently, it is often possible for the Moon to be seen during daylight, and to have moonless nights. It is also possible that a moonrise or moonset does not occur relative to a specific place on a given date.\n\nTransit. The transit time of a celestial body refers to the instant that its center crosses an imaginary line in the sky - the observer's meridian - running from north to south.\n\nTwilight. Before sunrise and again after sunset there are intervals of time, known as \u201ctwilight,\u201d during which there is natural light provided by the upper atmosphere, which does receive direct sunlight and reflects part of it toward the Earth's surface.\n\nCivil twilight is defined to begin in the morning, and to end in the evening when the center of the Sun is geometrically 6 degrees below the horizon. This is the limit at which twilight illumination is sufficient, under good weather conditions, for terrestrial objects to be clearly distinguished.\n\n\nTitle 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations applies these concepts and definitions in addressing the definition of night (Section 1.1), the requirement for aircraft lighting (Section 91.209) and pilot recency of night experience (Section 61.67).\n\nInformation on Moon Phases and Changes in the Percentage of the Moon Illuminated\nFrom any location on the Earth, the Moon appears to be a circular disk which, at any specific time, is illuminated to some degree by direct sunlight. During each lunar orbit (a lunar month), we see the Moon's appearance change from not visibly illuminated through partially illuminated to fully illuminated, then back through partially illuminated to not illuminated again. There are eight distinct, traditionally recognized stages, called phases. The phases designate both the degree to which the Moon is illuminated and the geometric appearance of the illuminated part. These phases of the Moon, in the sequence of their occurrence (starting from New Moon), are listed in FIG 10-2-3.FIG 10-2-3Phases of the Moon\n\nThe percent of the Moon's surface illuminated is a more refined, quantitative description of the Moon's appearance than is the phase. Considering the Moon as a circular disk, at New Moon the percent illuminated is 0; at First and Last Quarters it is 50%; and at Full Moon it is 100%. During the crescent phases the percent illuminated is between 0 and 50% and during gibbous phases it is between 50% and 100%.\n\n\nFor practical purposes, phases of the Moon and the percent of the Moon illuminated are independent of the location on the Earth from where the Moon is observed. That is, all the phases occur at the same time regardless of the observer's position.\n\nFor more detailed information, refer to the United States Naval Observatory site referenced below.\n\nAccess to Astronomical Data for Determination of Moon Rise, Moon Set, and Percentage of Lunar Disk Illuminated\n\nAstronomical data for the determination of Moon rise and set and Moon phase may be obtained from the United States Naval Observatory using an interactive query available at: http://aa.usno.navy.mil/\n\n\nClick on \u201cData Services,\u201d and then on \u201cComplete Sun and Moon Data for One Day.\u201d\n\nYou can obtain the times of sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, transits of the Sun and Moon, and the beginning and end of civil twilight, along with information on the Moon's phase by specifying the date and location in one of the two forms on this web page and clicking on the \u201cGet data\u201d button at the end of the form.

                "section-content": "This information is provided for use by helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) pilots, program managers, medical personnel, law enforcement, fire, and rescue personnel to further their understanding of the safety issues concerning Landing Zones (LZs). It is recommended that HEMS operators establish working relationships with the ground responder organizations they may come in contact with in their flight operations and share this information in order to establish a common frame of reference for LZ selection, operations, and safety.\n\n\nThe information provided is largely based on the booklet, LZ - Preparing the Landing Zone, issued by National Emergency Medical Services Pilots Association (NEMSPA), and the guidance developed by the University of Tennessee Medical Center's LIFESTAR program, and is used with their permission. For additional information, go to http://www.nemspa.org/.\n\nInformation concerning the estimation of wind velocity is based on the Beaufort Scale. See http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/beaufort.html for more information.\n\nSelecting a Scene LZ\n\nIf the situation requires the use of a helicopter, first check to see if there is an area large enough to land a helicopter safely.\nFIG 10-2-4Recommended Minimum Landing Zone Dimensions\n\n\nFor the purposes of FIG 10-2-4 the following are provided as examples of relative helicopter size:\n\nSmall Helicopter: Bell 206/407, Eurocopter AS-350/355, BO-105, BK-117.\n\n\nMedium Helicopter: Bell UH-1 (Huey) and derivatives (Bell 212/412), Bell 222/230/430 Sikorsky S-76, Eurocopter SA-365.\n\nLarge Helicopter: Boeing Chinook, Eurocopter Puma, Sikorsky H-60 series (Blackhawk), SK-92.\n\nThe LZ should be level, firm and free of loose debris that could possibly blow up into the rotor system.\n\nThe LZ should be clear of people, vehicles and obstructions such as trees, poles and wires. Remember that wires are difficult to see from the air. The LZ must also be free of stumps, brush, post and large rocks. See FIG 10-2-5.\nFIG 10-2-5Landing Zone Hazards\n\nKeep spectators back at least 200 feet. Keep emergency vehicles 100 feet away and have fire equipment (if available) standing by. Ground personnel should wear eye protection, if available, during landing and takeoff operations.  To avoid loose objects being blown around in the LZ, hats should be removed; if helmets are worn, chin straps must be securely fastened.\n\nFire fighters (if available) should wet down the LZ if it is extremely dusty.\n\nHelping the Flightcrew Locate the Scene\n\nIf the LZ coordinator has access to a GPS unit, the exact latitude and longitude of the LZ should be relayed to the HEMS pilot. If unable to contact the pilot directly, relay the information to the HEMS ground communications specialist for relaying to the pilot, so that they may locate your scene more efficiently.  Recognize that the aircraft may approach from a direction different than the direct path from the takeoff point to the scene, as the pilot may have to detour around terrain, obstructions or weather en\u2009route.\n\n\nEspecially in daylight hours, mountainous and densely populated areas can make sighting a scene from the air difficult. Often, the LZ coordinator on the ground will be asked if she or he can see or hear the helicopter.\n\nFlightcrews use a clock reference method for directing one another's attention to a certain direction from the aircraft. The nose of the aircraft is always 12\u2009o'clock, the right side is 3 o'clock, etc. When the LZ coordinator sees the aircraft, he/she should use this method to assist the flightcrew by indicating the scene's clock reference position from the nose of the aircraft. For example, \u201cAccident scene is located at your 2 o'clock position.\u201d See FIG 10-2-6.\nFIG 10-2-6\u201cClock\u201d System for Identifying Positions Relative to the Nose of the Aircraft\n\nWhen the helicopter approaches the scene, it will normally orbit at least one time as the flight crew observes the wind direction and obstacles that could interfere with the landing. This is often referred to as the \u201chigh reconnaissance\u201d maneuver.\n\nWind Direction and Touchdown Area\n\nDetermine from which direction the wind is blowing. Helicopters normally land and takeoff into the wind.\n\n\nIf contact can be established with the pilot, either directly or indirectly through the HEMS ground communications specialist, describe the wind in terms of the direction the wind is from and the speed.\n\nCommon natural sources of wind direction information are smoke, dust, vegetation movement, water streaks and waves. Flags, pennants, streamers can also be used. When describing the direction, use the compass direction from which the wind is blowing (example: from the North-West).\n\nWind speed can be measured by small hand-held measurement devices, or an observer's estimate can be used to provide velocity information. The wind value should be reported in knots (nautical miles per hour). If unable to numerically measure wind speed, use TBL 10-2-3 to estimate velocity. Also, report if the wind conditions are gusty, or if the wind direction or velocity is variable or has changed recently.\n\nIf any obstacle(s) exist, ensure their description, position and approximate height are communicated to the pilot on the initial radio call.\nTBL 10-2-3Table of Common References for Estimating Wind Velocity\n\n\n\nWind (Knots)\n\n\nWind Classification\n\n\nAppearance of Wind Effects\n\n\n\n\nOn the Water\n\n\nOn Land\n\n\n\n\nLess than 1\n\n\nCalm\n\n\nSea surface smooth and mirror-like\n\n\nCalm, smoke rises vertically\n\n\n\n\n1-3\n\n\nLight Air\n\n\nScaly ripples, no foam crests\n\n\nSmoke drift indicates wind direction, wind vanes are still\n\n\n\n\n4-6\n\n\nLight Breeze\n\n\nSmall wavelets, crests glassy, no breaking\n\n\nWind felt on face, leaves rustle, vanes begin to move\n\n\n\n\n7-10\n\n\nGentle Breeze\n\n\nLarge wavelets, crests begin to break, scattered whitecaps\n\n\nLeaves and small twigs constantly moving, light flags extended\n\n\n\n\n11-16\n\n\nModerate Breeze\n\n\nSmall waves 1-4 ft. becoming longer, numerous whitecaps\n\n\nDust, leaves, and loose paper lifted, small tree branches move\n\n\n\n\n17-21\n\n\nFresh Breeze\n\n\nModerate waves 4-8 ft. taking longer form, many whitecaps, some spray\n\n\nSmall trees in leaf begin to sway\n\n\n\n\n22-27\n\n\nStrong Breeze\n\n\nLarger waves 8-13 ft., whitecaps common, more spray\n\n\nLarger tree branches moving, whistling in wires\n\n\n\n\n28-33\n\n\nNear Gale\n\n\nSea heaps up, waves 13-20 ft., white foam streaks off breakers\n\n\nWhole trees moving, resistance felt walking against wind\n\n\n\n\n34-40\n\n\nGale\n\n\nModerately high (13-20 ft.) waves of greater length, edges of crests begin to break into spindrift, foam blown in streaks\n\n\nWhole trees in motion, resistance felt walking against wind\n\n\n\n\n41-47\n\n\nStrong Gale\n\n\nHigh waves (20 ft.), sea begins to roll, dense streaks of foam, spray may reduce visibility\n\n\nSlight structural damage occurs, slate blows off roofs\n\n\n\n\n48-55\n\n\nStorm\n\n\nVery high waves (20-30 ft.) with overhanging crests, sea white with densely blown foam, heavy rolling, lowered visibility\n\n\nSeldom experienced on land, trees broken or uprooted, \u201cconsiderable structural damage\u201d\n\n\n\n\n56-63\n\n\nViolent Storm\n\n\nExceptionally high (30-45 ft.) waves, foam patches cover sea, visibility more reduced\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n64+\n\n\nHurricane\n\n\nAir filled with foam, waves over 45\u2009ft., sea completely white with driving spray, visibility greatly reduced\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE-\nWind from the South-East, estimated speed 15 knots. Wind shifted from North-East about fifteen minutes ago, and is gusty.\nNight LZs\n\nThere are several ways to light a night LZ:\n\nMark the touchdown area with five lights or road flares, one in each corner and one indicating the direction of the wind. See FIG 10-2-7.\nFIG 10-2-7Recommended Lighting for Landing Zone Operations at Night\n\nNOTE-\nRoad flares are an intense source of ignition and may be unsuitable or dangerous in certain conditions. In any case, they must be closely managed and firefighting equipment should be present when used. Other light sources are preferred, if available.\n\n\nIf chemical light sticks may be used, care should be taken to assure they are adequately secured against being dislodged by the helicopter's rotor wash.\n\nAnother method of marking a LZ uses four emergency vehicles with their low beam headlights aimed toward the intended landing area.\n\nA third method for marking a LZ uses two vehicles. Have the vehicles direct their headlight beams into the wind, crossing at the center of the LZ. (If fire/rescue personnel are available, the reflective stripes on their bunker gear will assist the pilot greatly.)\n\n\nAt night, spotlights, flood lights and hand lights used to define the LZ are not to be pointed at the helicopter. However, they are helpful when pointed toward utility poles, trees or other hazards to the landing aircraft. White lights such as spotlights, flashbulbs and hi-beam headlights ruin the pilot's night vision and temporarily blind him. Red lights, however, are very helpful in finding accident locations and do not affect the pilot's night vision as significantly.\n\nAs in Day LZ operations, ensure radio contact is accomplished between ground and air, if possible.\n\nGround Guide\n\nWhen the helicopter is in sight, one person should assist the LZ Coordinator by guiding the helicopter into a safe landing area. In selecting an LZ Coordinator, recognize that medical personnel usually are very busy with the patient at this time. It is recommended that the LZ Coordinator be someone other than a medical responder, if possible. Eye protection should be worn. The ground guide should stand with his/her back to the wind and his/her arms raised over his/her head (flashlights in each hand for night operations.)\n\n\nThe pilot will confirm the LZ sighting by radio. If possible, once the pilot has identified the LZ, the ground guide should move out of the LZ.\n\nAs the helicopter turns into the wind and begins a descent, the LZ coordinator should provide assistance by means of radio contact, or utilize the \u201cunsafe signal\u201d to wave off the helicopter if the LZ is not safe (see FIG 10-2-8). The LZ Coordinator should be far enough from the touchdown area that he/she can still maintain visual contact with the pilot.\n\nAssisting the Crew\n\nAfter the helicopter has landed, do not approach the helicopter. The crew will approach you.\n\n\nBe prepared to assist the crew by providing security for the helicopter. If asked to provide security, allow no one but the crew to approach the aircraft.\n\nOnce the patient is prepared and ready to load, allow the crew to open the doors to the helicopter and guide the loading of the patient.\n\nWhen approaching or departing the helicopter, always be aware of the tail rotor and always follow the directions of the crew. Working around a running helicopter can be potentially dangerous.  The environment is very noisy and, with exhaust gases and rotor wash, often windy. In scene operations, the surface may be uneven, soft, or slippery which can lead to tripping. Be very careful of your footing in this environment.\n\nThe tail rotor poses a special threat to working\u2009around a running helicopter. The tail rotor turns many times faster than the main rotor, and is often invisible even at idle engine power. Avoid walking towards the tail of a helicopter beyond the end of the cabin, unless specifically directed by the crew.\n\nNOTE-\nHelicopters typically have doors on the sides of the cabin, but many use aft mounted \u201cclamshell\u201d type doors for loading and unloading patients on litters or stretchers. When using these doors, it is important to avoid moving any further aft than necessary to operate the doors and load/unload the patient. Again, always comply with the crew's instructions.\n\nGeneral Rules\n\nWhen working around helicopters, always approach and depart from the front, never from the rear. Approaching from the rear can increase your risk of being struck by the tail rotor, which, when at operating engine speed, is nearly invisible.\n\n\nTo prevent injury or damage from the main rotor, never raise anything over your head.\n\nIf the helicopter landed on a slope, approach and depart from the down slope side only.\n\nWhen the helicopter is loaded and ready for take off, keep the departure path free of vehicles and spectators. In an emergency, this area is needed to execute a landing.\n\nHazardous Chemicals and Gases\n\nResponding to accidents involving hazardous materials requires special handling by fire/rescue units on the ground. Equally important are the preparations and considerations for helicopter operations in these areas.\n\n\nHazardous materials of concern are those which are toxic, poisonous, flammable, explosive, irritating, or radioactive in nature. Helicopter ambulance crews normally don't carry protective suits or breathing apparatuses to protect them from hazardous materials.\n\nThe helicopter ambulance crew must be told of hazardous materials on the scene in order to avoid the contamination of the crew. Patients/victims contaminated by hazardous materials may require special precautions in packaging before loading on the aircraft for the medical crew's protection, or may be transported by other means.\n\nHazardous chemicals and gases may be fatal to the unprotected person if inhaled or absorbed through the skin.\n\nUpon initial radio contact, the helicopter crew must be made aware of any hazardous gases in the area. Never assume that the crew has already been informed. If the aircraft were to fly through the hazardous gases, the crew could be poisoned and/or the engines could develop mechanical problems.\n\nPoisonous or irritating gases may cling to a victim's clothing and go unnoticed until the patient is loaded and the doors of the helicopter are closed. To avoid possible compromise of the crew, all of these patients must be decontaminated prior to loading.\n\nHand Signals\n\nIf unable to make radio contact with the HEMS pilot, use the following signals:\nFIG 10-2-8Recommended Landing Zone Ground Signals\n\n\nEmergency Situations\n\nIn the event of a helicopter accident in the vicinity of the LZ, consider the following:\n\nEmergency Exits:\n\nDoors and emergency exits are typically prominently marked. If possible, operators should familiarize ground responders with the door system on their helicopter in preparation for an emergency event.\n\n\nIn the event of an accident during the LZ operation, be cautious of hazards such as sharp and jagged metal, plastic windows, glass, any rotating components, such as the rotors, and fire sources, such as the fuel tank(s) and the engine.\n\n\nFire Suppression:\nHelicopters used in HEMS operations are usually powered by turboshaft engines, which use jet fuel. Civil HEMS aircraft typically carry between 50 and 250 gallons of fuel, depending upon the size of the helicopter, and planned flight duration, and the fuel remaining after flying to the scene. Use water to control heat and use foam over fuel to keep vapors from ignition sources."

                "section-content": "Background. EMS helicopter operators often overlap other EMS operator areas. Standardized procedures can enhance the safety of operating multiple helicopters to landing zones (LZs) and to hospital heliports. Communication is the key to successful operations and in maintaining organization between helicopters, ground units and communication centers. EMS helicopter operators which operate in the same areas should establish joint operating procedures and provide them to related agencies.\n\n\nRecommended Procedures.\n\nLanding Zone Operations. The first helicopter to arrive on-scene should establish communications with the ground unit at least 10 NMs from the LZ to receive a LZ briefing and to provide ground control the number of helicopters that can be expected. An attempt should be made to contact other helicopters on 123.025 to pass on to them pertinent LZ information and the ground unit's frequency. Subsequent helicopters arriving on scene should establish communications on 123.025 at least 10 NMs from the LZ. After establishing contact on 123.025, they should contact the ground unit for additional information. All helicopters should monitor 123.025 at all times.\n\nIf the landing zone is not established by the ground unit when the first helicopter arrives, then\u2009the first helicopter should establish altitude and\u2009orbit location requirements for the other arriving\u2009helicopters. Recommended altitude separation between helicopters is 500 feet (weather and airspace permitting). Helicopters can orbit on cardinal headings from the scene coordinates. (See FIG 10-2-9.)\n\n\nUpon landing in the LZ, the first helicopter should update the other helicopters on the LZ conditions, i.e., space, hazards and terrain.\n\nBefore initiating any helicopter movement to leave the LZ, all operators should attempt to contact other helicopters on 123.025, and state their position and route of flight intentions for departing the LZ.\n\n\nHospital Operations. Because many hospitals\u2009require landing permission and have established procedures (frequencies to monitor, primary and secondary routes for approaches and departures, and orbiting areas if the heliport is occupied) pilots should always receive a briefing from the appropriate facility (communication center, flight following, etc.) before proceeding to the hospital.\n\nIn the event of multiple helicopters coming into the hospital heliport, the helicopter nearest to the heliport should contact other inbound helicopters on 123.025 and establish intentions. Follow the guidelines established in the LZ operations.\n\n\nTo facilitate approach times, the pilot-in-command of the helicopter occupying the hospital heliport should advise any other operators whether the patient will be off loaded with the rotor blades turning or stopped, and the approximate time to do so.\n\nBefore making any helicopter movement to leave the hospital heliport, all operators should attempt to contact other helicopters on 123.025 and state their position and route of flight intentions for departing the heliport.\nFIG 10-2-9EMS Multiple Helicopter LZ/Heliport Operation\n\nNOTE-\nIf the LZ/hospital heliport weather conditions or airspace altitude restrictions prohibit the recommended vertical separation, 1 NM separations should be kept between helicopter orbit areas."

The term RNAV in this context, as in procedure titles, just means \u201carea navigation,\u201d regardless of the equipment capability of the aircraft. (See FIG 1-2-1.) Many operators have upgraded their systems to obtain the benefits of PBN. Within PBN there are two main categories of navigation methods or specifications: area navigation (RNAV) and required navigation performance (RNP). In this context, the term RNAV x means a specific navigation specification with a specified lateral accuracy value. For an aircraft to meet the requirements of PBN, a specified RNAV or RNP accuracy must be met 95 percent of the flight time. RNP is a PBN system that includes onboard performance monitoring and alerting capability (for example, Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM)). PBN also introduces the concept of navigation specifications (NavSpecs) which are a set of aircraft and aircrew requirements needed to support a navigation application within a defined airspace concept. For both RNP and RNAV NavSpecs, the numerical designation refers to the lateral navigation accuracy in nautical miles which is expected to be achieved at least 95 percent of the flight time by the population of aircraft operating within the airspace, route, or procedure. This information is detailed in International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Doc 9613, Performance-based Navigation (PBN) Manual and the latest FAA AC 90-105, Approval Guidance for RNP Operations and Barometric Vertical Navigation in the U.S. National Airspace System and in Remote and Oceanic Airspace.\nFIG 1-2-1Navigation Specifications\n\n\nArea Navigation (RNAV)\n\nGeneral. RNAV is a method of navigation that permits aircraft operation on any desired flight path within the coverage of ground- or space-based navigation aids or within the limits of the capability of self-contained aids, or a combination of these. In the future, there will be an increased dependence on the use of RNAV in lieu of routes defined by ground-based navigation aids. RNAV routes and terminal procedures, including departure procedures (DPs) and standard terminal arrivals (STARs), are designed with RNAV systems in mind. There are several potential advantages of RNAV routes and procedures:\n\nTime and fuel savings;\n\n\nReduced dependence on radar vectoring, altitude, and speed assignments allowing a reduction in required ATC radio transmissions; and\n\nMore efficient use of airspace.\nIn addition to information found in this manual, guidance for domestic RNAV DPs, STARs, and routes may also be found in AC 90-100, U.S. Terminal and En Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations.\n\nRNAV Operations. RNAV procedures, such as DPs and STARs, demand strict pilot awareness and maintenance of the procedure centerline. Pilots should possess a working knowledge of their aircraft navigation system to ensure RNAV procedures are flown in an appropriate manner. In addition, pilots should have an understanding of the various waypoint and leg types used in RNAV procedures; these are discussed in more detail below.\n\nWaypoints. A waypoint is a predetermined geographical position that is defined in terms of latitude/longitude coordinates. Waypoints may be a simple named point in space or associated with existing navaids, intersections, or fixes. A waypoint is most often used to indicate a change in direction, speed, or altitude along the desired path. RNAV procedures make use of both fly-over and fly-by waypoints.\n\nFly-by waypoints. Fly-by waypoints are used when an aircraft should begin a turn to the next course prior to reaching the waypoint separating the two route segments. This is known as turn anticipation.\n\n\nFly-over waypoints. Fly-over waypoints are used when the aircraft must fly over the point prior to starting a turn.\n\nNOTE-\nFIG 1-2-2 illustrates several differences between a fly-by and a fly-over waypoint.\nFIG 1-2-2Fly-by and Fly-over Waypoints\n\n\nRNAV Leg Types. A leg type describes the desired path proceeding, following, or between waypoints on an RNAV procedure. Leg types are identified by a two-letter code that describes the path (e.g., heading, course, track, etc.) and the termination point (e.g., the path terminates at an altitude, distance, fix, etc.). Leg types used for procedure design are included in the aircraft navigation database, but not normally provided on the procedure chart. The narrative depiction of the RNAV chart describes how a procedure is flown. The \u201cpath and terminator concept\u201d defines that every leg of a procedure has a termination point and some kind of path into that termination point. Some of the available leg types are described below.\n\nTrack to Fix. A Track to Fix (TF) leg is intercepted and acquired as the flight track to the following waypoint. Track to a Fix legs are sometimes called point-to-point legs for this reason. Narrative: \u201cdirect ALPHA, then on course to BRAVO WP.\u201d See FIG 1-2-3.\n\n\nDirect to Fix. A Direct to Fix (DF) leg is a path described by an aircraft's track from an initial area direct to the next waypoint. Narrative: \u201cturn right direct BRAVO WP.\u201d See FIG 1-2-4.\nFIG 1-2-3Track to Fix Leg Type\nFIG 1-2-4Direct to Fix Leg Type\n\nCourse to Fix. A Course to Fix (CF) leg is a path that terminates at a fix with a specified course at that fix. Narrative: \u201con course 150 to ALPHA WP.\u201d See FIG 1-2-5.\nFIG 1-2-5Course to Fix Leg Type\n\nRadius to Fix. A Radius to Fix (RF) leg is defined as a constant radius circular path around a defined turn center that terminates at a fix. See FIG 1-2-6.\nFIG 1-2-6Radius to Fix Leg Type\n\nHeading. A Heading leg may be defined as, but not limited to, a Heading to Altitude (VA), Heading to DME range (VD), and Heading to Manual Termination, i.e., Vector (VM). Narrative: \u201cclimb heading 350 to 1500\u201d, \u201cheading 265, at 9 DME west of PXR VORTAC, right turn heading 360\u201d, \u201cfly heading 090, expect radar vectors to DRYHT INT.\u201d\n\nNavigation Issues. Pilots should be aware of their navigation system inputs, alerts, and annunciations in order to make better-informed decisions. In addition, the availability and suitability of particular sensors/systems should be considered.\n\nGPS/WAAS. Operators using TSO-C129(), TSO-C196(), TSO-C145() or TSO-C146() systems should ensure departure and arrival airports are entered to ensure proper RAIM availability and CDI sensitivity.\n\n\nDME/DME. Operators should be aware that DME/DME position updating is dependent on navigation system logic and DME facility proximity, availability, geometry, and signal masking.\n\nVOR/DME. Unique VOR characteristics may result in less accurate values from VOR/DME position updating than from GPS or DME/DME position updating.\n\nInertial Navigation. Inertial reference units and inertial navigation systems are often coupled with other types of navigation inputs, e.g.,\u2009DME/DME or GPS, to improve overall navigation system performance.\n\nNOTE-\nSpecific inertial position updating requirements may apply.\n\nFlight Management System (FMS). An FMS is an integrated suite of sensors, receivers, and computers, coupled with a navigation database. These systems generally provide performance and RNAV guidance to displays and automatic flight control systems.\nInputs can be accepted from multiple sources such as GPS, DME, VOR, LOC and IRU. These inputs may be applied to a navigation solution one at a time or in combination. Some FMSs provide for the detection and isolation of faulty navigation information.When appropriate navigation signals are available, FMSs will normally rely on GPS and/or DME/DME (that is, the use of distance information from two or more DME stations) for position updates. Other inputs may also be incorporated based on FMS system architecture and navigation source geometry.\nNOTE-\nDME/DME inputs coupled with one or more IRU(s) are often abbreviated as DME/DME/IRU or D/D/I.\n\nRNAV Navigation Specifications (Nav Specs)\nNav Specs are a set of aircraft and aircrew requirements needed to support a navigation application within a defined airspace concept. For both RNP and RNAV designations, the numerical designation refers to the lateral navigation accuracy in nautical miles which is expected to be achieved at least 95 percent of the flight time by the population of aircraft operating within the airspace, route, or procedure. (See FIG 1-2-1.)\nRNAV 1. Typically RNAV 1 is used for DPs and STARs and appears on the charts. Aircraft must maintain a total system error of not more than 1\u2009NM for 95 percent of the total flight time.\n\n\nRNAV 2. Typically RNAV 2 is used for en route operations unless otherwise specified. T-routes and Q-routes are examples of this Nav Spec. Aircraft must maintain a total system error of not more than 2 NM for 95 percent of the total flight time.\n\nRNAV 10. Typically RNAV 10 is used in oceanic operations. See paragraph 4-7-1 for specifics and explanation of the relationship between RNP 10 and RNAV 10 terminology."

                "section-title": "Required Navigation Performance (RNP)",
                "section-content": "General. While both RNAV navigation specifications (NavSpecs) and RNP NavSpecs contain specific performance requirements, RNP is RNAV with the added requirement for onboard performance monitoring and alerting (OBPMA). RNP is also a statement of navigation performance necessary for operation within a defined airspace. A critical component of RNP is the ability of the aircraft navigation system to monitor its achieved navigation performance, and to identify for the pilot whether the operational requirement is, or is not, being met during an operation. OBPMA capability therefore allows a lessened reliance on air traffic control intervention and/or procedural separation to achieve the overall safety of the operation. RNP capability of the aircraft is a major component in determining the separation criteria to ensure that the overall containment of the operation is met. The RNP capability of an aircraft will vary depending upon the aircraft equipment and the navigation infrastructure. For example, an aircraft may be eligible for RNP 1, but may not be capable of RNP 1 operations due to limited NAVAID coverage or avionics failure. The Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) or avionics documents for your aircraft should specifically state the aircraft's RNP eligibilities. Contact the manufacturer of the avionics or the aircraft if this information is missing or incomplete. NavSpecs should be considered different from one another, not \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cworse\u201d based on the described lateral navigation accuracy. It is this concept that requires each NavSpec eligbility to be listed separately in the avionics documents or AFM. For example, RNP 1 is different from RNAV\u20091, and an RNP 1 eligibility does NOT mean automatic RNP 2 or RNAV 1 eligibility. As a safeguard, the FAA requires that aircraft navigation databases hold only those procedures that the aircraft maintains eligibility for. If you look for a specific instrument procedure in your aircraft's navigation database and cannot find it, it's likely that procedure contains PBN elements your aircraft is ineligible for or cannot compute and fly. Further, optional capabilities such as Radius-to-fix (RF) turns or scalability should be described in the AFM or avionics documents. Use the capabilities of your avionics suite to verify the appropriate waypoint and track data after loading the procedure from your database.\n\n\nPBN Operations.\n\nLateral Accuracy Values. Lateral Accuracy values are applicable to a selected airspace, route, or procedure. The lateral accuracy value is a value typically expressed as a distance in nautical miles from the intended centerline of a procedure, route, or path. RNP applications also account for potential errors at some multiple of lateral accuracy value (for example, twice the RNP lateral accuracy values).\n\nRNP NavSpecs. U.S. standard NavSpecs supporting typical RNP airspace uses are as specified below. Other NavSpecs may include different lateral accuracy values as identified by ICAO or other states. (See FIG 1-2-1.)\n\nRNP Approach (RNP APCH). In the U.S., RNP APCH procedures are titled RNAV (GPS) and offer several lines of minima to accommodate varying levels of aircraft equipage: either lateral navigation (LNAV), LNAV/vertical navigation (LNAV/VNAV), Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV), and Localizer Performance (LP). GPS with or without Space-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) (for example, WAAS) can provide the lateral information to support LNAV minima. LNAV/VNAV incorporates LNAV lateral with vertical path guidance for systems and operators capable of either barometric or SBAS vertical. Pilots are required to use SBAS to fly to the LPV or LP minima. RF turn capability is optional in RNP APCH eligibility. This means that your aircraft may be eligible for RNP APCH operations, but you may not fly an RF turn unless RF turns are also specifically listed as a feature of your avionics suite. GBAS Landing System (GLS) procedures are also constructed using RNP APCH NavSpecs and provide precision approach capability. RNP APCH has a lateral accuracy value of 1 in the terminal and missed approach segments and essentially scales to RNP 0.3 (or 40 meters with SBAS) in the final approach. (See paragraph 5-4-18, RNP AR (Authorization Required) Instrument Procedures.)\n\n\nRNP Authorization Required Approach (RNP AR APCH). In the U.S., RNP AR APCH procedures are titled RNAV (RNP). These approaches have stringent equipage and pilot training standards and require special FAA authorization to fly. Scalability and RF turn capabilities are mandatory in RNP AR APCH eligibility. RNP AR APCH vertical navigation performance is based upon barometric VNAV or SBAS. RNP AR is intended to provide specific benefits at specific locations. It is not intended for every operator or aircraft. RNP AR capability requires specific aircraft performance, design, operational processes, training, and specific procedure design criteria to achieve the required target level of safety. RNP AR APCH has lateral accuracy values that can range below 1 in the terminal and missed approach segments and essentially scale to RNP 0.3 or lower in the final approach. Before conducting these procedures, operators should refer to the latest AC 90-101, Approval Guidance for RNP Procedures with AR. (See paragraph 5-4-18.)\n\nRNP Authorization Required Departure (RNP AR DP). Similar to RNP AR approaches, RNP AR departure procedures have stringent equipage and pilot training standards and require special FAA authorization to fly. Scalability and RF turn capabilities is mandatory in RNP AR DP eligibility. RNP AR DP is intended to provide specific benefits at specific locations. It is not intended for every operator or aircraft. RNP AR DP capability requires specific aircraft performance, design, operational processes, training, and specific procedure design criteria to achieve the required target level of safety. RNP AR DP has lateral accuracy values that can scale to no lower than RNP 0.3 in the initial departure flight path. Before conducting these procedures, operators should refer to the latest AC 90-101, Approval Guidance for RNP Procedures with AR. (See paragraph 5-4-18.)\n\nAdvanced RNP (A-RNP). Advanced RNP is a NavSpec with a minimum set of mandatory functions enabled in the aircraft's avionics suite. In the U.S., these minimum functions include capability to calculate and perform RF turns, scalable RNP, and parallel offset flight path generation. Higher continuity (such as dual systems) may be required for certain oceanic and remote continental airspace. Other \u201cadvanced\u201d options for use in the en route environment (such as fixed radius transitions and Time of Arrival Control) are optional in the U.S. Typically, an aircraft eligible for A-RNP will also be eligible for operations comprising: RNP APCH, RNP/RNAV 1, RNP/RNAV 2, RNP 4, and RNP/RNAV 10. A-RNP allows for scalable RNP lateral navigation values (either 1.0 or 0.3) in the terminal environment. Use of these reduced lateral accuracies will normally require use of the aircraft's autopilot and/or flight director. See the latest AC 90-105 for more information on A-RNP, including NavSpec bundling options, eligibility determinations, and operations approvals.\n\nNOTE-\nA-RNP eligible aircraft are NOT automatically eligible for RNP AR APCH or RNP AR DP operations, as RNP AR eligibility requires a separate determination process and special FAA authorization.\n\nRNP 1. RNP 1 requires a lateral accuracy value of 1 for arrival and departure in the terminal area, and the initial and intermediate approach phase when used on conventional procedures with PBN segments (for example, an ILS with a PBN feeder, IAF, or missed approach). RF turn capability is optional in RNP 1 eligibility. This means that your aircraft may be eligible for RNP 1 operations, but you may not fly an RF turn unless RF turns are also specifically listed as a feature of your avionics suite.\n\nRNP 2. RNP 2 will apply to both domestic and oceanic/remote operations with a lateral accuracy value of 2.\n\nRNP 4. RNP 4 will apply to oceanic and remote operations only with a lateral accuracy value of 4. RNP 4 eligibility will automatically confer RNP\u200910 eligibility.\n\nRNP 10. The RNP 10 NavSpec applies to certain oceanic and remote operations with a lateral accuracy of 10. In such airspace, the RNAV 10 NavSpec will be applied, so any aircraft eligible for RNP 10 will be deemed eligible for RNAV 10 operations. Further, any aircraft eligible for RNP 4 operations is automatically qualified for RNP 10/ RNAV 10 operations. (See also the latest AC 91-70, Oceanic and Remote Continental Airspace Operations, for more information on oceanic RNP/RNAV operations.)\n\nRNP 0.3. The RNP 0.3 NavSpec requires a lateral accuracy value of 0.3 for all authorized phases of flight. RNP 0.3 is not authorized for oceanic, remote, or the final approach segment. Use of RNP 0.3 by slow-flying fixed-wing aircraft is under consideration, but the RNP 0.3 NavSpec initially will apply only to rotorcraft operations. RF turn capability is optional in RNP 0.3 eligibility. This means that your aircraft may be eligible for RNP 0.3 operations, but you may not fly an RF turn unless RF turns are also specifically listed as a feature of your avionics suite.\n\nNOTE-\nOn terminal procedures or en route charts, do not confuse a charted RNP value of 0.30, or any standard final approach course segment width of 0.30, with the NavSpec title \u201cRNP 0.3.\u201d Charted RNP values of 0.30 or below should contain two decimal places (for example, RNP 0.15, or 0.10, or 0.30) whereas the NavSpec title will only state \u201cRNP 0.3.\u201d\n\n\nApplication of Standard Lateral Accuracy Values. U.S. standard lateral accuracy values typically used for various routes and procedures supporting RNAV operations may be based on use of a specific navigational system or sensor such as GPS, or on multi-sensor RNAV systems having suitable performance.\n\nDepiction of PBN Requirements. In the U.S., PBN requirements like Lateral Accuracy Values or NavSpecs applicable to a procedure will be depicted on affected charts and procedures. In the U.S., a specific procedure's Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) requirements will be prominently displayed in separate, standardized notes boxes. For procedures with PBN elements, the \u201cPBN box\u201d will contain the procedure's NavSpec(s); and, if required: specific sensors or infrastructure needed for the navigation solution, any additional or advanced functional requirements, the minimum RNP value, and any amplifying remarks. Items listed in this PBN box are REQUIRED to fly the procedure's PBN elements. For example, an ILS with an RNAV missed approach would require a specific capability to fly the missed approach portion of the procedure. That required capability will be listed in the PBN box. The separate Equipment Requirements box will list ground-based equipment and/or airport specific requirements. On procedures with both PBN elements and ground-based equipment requirements, the PBN requirements box will be listed first. (See FIG 5-4-1.)\n\n\nOther RNP Applications Outside the U.S. The FAA and ICAO member states have led initiatives in implementing the RNP concept to oceanic operations. For example, RNP-10 routes have been established in the northern Pacific (NOPAC) which has increased capacity and efficiency by reducing the distance between tracks to\u200950 NM. (See paragraph 4-7-1.)\n\nAircraft and Airborne Equipment Eligibility for RNP Operations. Aircraft eligible for RNP operations will have an appropriate entry including special conditions and limitations in its AFM, avionics manual, or a supplement. Operators of aircraft not having specific RNP eligibility statements in the AFM or avionics documents may be issued operational approval including special conditions and limitations for specific RNP eligibilities.\n\nNOTE-\nSome airborne systems use Estimated Position Uncertainty (EPU) as a measure of the current estimated navigational performance. EPU may also be referred to as Actual Navigation Performance (ANP) or Estimated Position Error (EPE).\nTBL 1-2-1U.S. Standard RNP Levels\n\n\n\nRNP Level\n\n\nTypical Application\n\n\nPrimary Route Width (NM) - Centerline to Boundary\n\n\n\n\n0.1 to 1.0\n\n\nRNP AR Approach Segments\n\n\n0.1 to 1.0\n\n\n\n\n0.3 to 1.0\n\n\nRNP Approach Segments\n\n\n0.3 to 1.0\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nTerminal and En Route\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nEn Route\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nOceanic/remote areas where performance-based horizontal separation is applied.\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nOceanic/remote areas where performance-based horizontal separation is applied.\n\n\n10.0"

                "section-title": "Use of Suitable Area Navigation (RNAV) Systems on Conventional Procedures and Routes",
                "section-content": "Discussion. This paragraph sets forth policy, while providing operational and airworthiness guidance regarding the suitability and use of RNAV systems when operating on, or transitioning to, conventional, non-RNAV routes and procedures within the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS):\n\nUse of a suitable RNAV system as a Substitute Means of Navigation when a Very-High Frequency (VHF) Omni-directional Range (VOR), Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), VOR/TACAN (VORTAC), VOR/DME, Non-directional Beacon (NDB), or compass locator facility including locator outer marker and locator middle marker is out-of-service (that is, the navigation aid (NAVAID) information is not available); an aircraft is not equipped with an Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) or DME; or the installed ADF or DME on an aircraft is not operational. For example, if equipped with a suitable RNAV system, a pilot may hold over an out-of-service NDB.\n\n\nUse of a suitable RNAV system as an Alternate Means of Navigation when  a VOR, DME, VORTAC, VOR/DME, TACAN, NDB, or compass locator facility including locator outer marker and locator middle marker is operational and the respective aircraft is equipped with operational navigation equipment that is compatible with conventional navaids. For example, if equipped with a suitable RNAV system, a pilot may fly a procedure or route based on operational VOR using that RNAV system without monitoring the VOR.\n\nNOTE-\nAdditional information and associated requirements are available in Advisory Circular 90-108 titled \u201cUse of Suitable RNAV Systems on Conventional Routes and Procedures.\u201dGood planning and knowledge of your RNAV system are critical for safe and successful operations.Pilots planning to use their RNAV system as a substitute means of navigation guidance in lieu of an out-of-service NAVAID may need to advise ATC of this intent and capability.The navigation database should be current for the duration of the flight. If the AIRAC cycle will change during flight, operators and pilots should establish procedures to ensure the accuracy of navigation data, including suitability of navigation facilities used to define the routes and procedures for flight.  To facilitate validating database currency, the FAA has developed procedures for publishing the amendment date that instrument approach procedures were last revised. The amendment date follows the amendment number, e.g., Amdt 4 14Jan10. Currency of graphic departure procedures and STARs may be ascertained by the numerical designation in the procedure title. If an amended chart is published for the procedure, or the procedure amendment date shown on the chart is on or after the expiration date of the database, the operator must not use the database to conduct the operation.\n\n\nTypes of RNAV Systems that Qualify as a Suitable RNAV System. When installed in accordance with appropriate airworthiness installation requirements and operated in accordance with applicable operational guidance (for example, aircraft flight manual and Advisory Circular material), the following systems qualify as a suitable RNAV system:\n\nAn RNAV system with TSO-C129/ -C145/-C146 equipment, installed in accordance with AC 20-138, Airworthiness Approval of Global Positioning System (GPS) Navigation Equipment for Use as a VFR and IFR Supplemental Navigation System, and authorized for instrument flight rules (IFR) en route and terminal operations (including those systems previously qualified for \u201cGPS in lieu of ADF or DME\u201d operations), or\n\n\nAn RNAV system with DME/DME/IRU inputs that is compliant with the equipment provisions of AC 90-100A, U.S. Terminal and En\u2009Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations, for RNAV routes. A table of compliant equipment is available at the following website:\nhttps://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/afx/afs/afs400/afs410/media/AC90-100compliance.pdf\n\nNOTE-\nApproved RNAV systems using DME/DME/IRU, without GPS/WAAS position input, may only be used as a substitute means of navigation when specifically authorized by a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) or other FAA guidance for a specific procedure. The NOTAM or other FAA guidance authorizing the use of DME/DME/IRU systems will also identify any required DME facilities based on an FAA assessment of the DME navigation infrastructure.\n\nUses of Suitable RNAV Systems. Subject to the operating requirements, operators may use a suitable RNAV system in the following ways.\n\nDetermine aircraft position relative to, or distance from a VOR (see NOTE 6 below), TACAN, NDB, compass locator, DME fix; or a named fix defined by a VOR radial, TACAN course, NDB bearing, or compass locator bearing intersecting a VOR or localizer course.\n\n\nNavigate to or from a VOR, TACAN, NDB, or compass locator.\n\nHold over a VOR, TACAN, NDB, compass locator, or DME fix.\n\nFly an arc based upon DME.\n\nNOTE-\nThe allowances described in this section apply even when a facility is identified as required on a procedure (for example, \u201cNote ADF required\u201d).These operations do not include lateral navigation on localizer-based courses (including localizer back-course guidance) without reference to raw localizer data. Unless otherwise specified, a suitable RNAV system cannot be used for navigation on procedures that are identified as not authorized (\u201cNA\u201d) without exception by a NOTAM.  For example, an operator may not use a RNAV system to navigate on a procedure affected by an expired or unsatisfactory flight inspection, or a procedure that is based upon a recently decommissioned NAVAID.Pilots may not substitute for the NAVAID (for example, a VOR or NDB) providing lateral guidance for the final approach segment. This restriction does not refer to instrument approach procedures with \u201cor GPS\u201d in the title when using GPS or WAAS. These allowances do not apply to procedures that are identified as not authorized (NA) without exception by a NOTAM, as other conditions may still exist and result in a procedure not being available. For example, these allowances do not apply to a procedure associated with an expired or unsatisfactory flight inspection, or is based upon a recently decommissioned NAVAID.Use of a suitable RNAV system as a means to navigate on the final approach segment of an instrument approach procedure based on a VOR, TACAN or NDB signal, is allowable. The underlying NAVAID must be operational and the NAVAID monitored for final segment course alignment. For the purpose of paragraph c, \u201cVOR\u201d includes VOR, VOR/DME, and VORTAC facilities and \u201ccompass locator\u201d includes locator outer marker and locator middle marker.\n\nAlternate Airport Considerations. For the purposes of flight planning, any required alternate airport must have an available instrument approach procedure that does not require the use of GPS. This restriction includes conducting a conventional approach at the alternate airport using a substitute means of navigation that is based upon the use of GPS. For example, these restrictions would apply when planning to use GPS equipment as a substitute means of navigation for an out-of-service VOR that supports an ILS missed approach procedure at an alternate airport. In this case, some other approach not reliant upon the use of GPS must be available. This restriction does not apply to RNAV systems using TSO-C145/-C146 WAAS equipment. For further WAAS guidance, see paragraph 1-1-18.\n\nFor flight planning purposes, TSO-C129() and TSO-C196() equipped users (GPS users) whose navigation systems have fault detection and exclusion (FDE) capability, who perform a preflight RAIM prediction at the airport where the RNAV (GPS) approach will be flown, and have proper knowledge and any required training and/or approval to conduct a GPS-based IAP, may file based on a GPS-based IAP at either the destination or the alternate airport, but not at both locations.  At the alternate airport, pilots may plan for applicable alternate airport weather minimums using:\n\nLateral navigation (LNAV) or circling minimum descent altitude (MDA);\n\n\nLNAV/vertical navigation (LNAV/VNAV) DA, if equipped with and using approved barometric vertical navigation (baro-VNAV) equipment;\n\nRNP 0.3 DA on an RNAV (RNP) IAP, if they are specifically authorized users using approved baro-VNAV equipment and the pilot has verified required navigation performance (RNP) availability through an approved prediction program.\n\n\nIf the above conditions cannot be met, any required alternate airport must have an approved instrument approach procedure other than GPS that is anticipated to be operational and available at the estimated time of arrival, and which the aircraft is equipped to fly.\n\nThis restriction does not apply to TSO-C145() and TSO-C146() equipped users (WAAS users). For further WAAS guidance, see paragraph 1-1-18."

                "section-content": "The low-strength data transmission signals from GPS satellites are vulnerable to various anomalies that can significantly reduce the reliability of the navigation signal. Because of the many uses of GPS in aviation (e.g., navigation, ADS-B, terrain awareness/warning systems), operators of aircraft using GPS need to be aware of these vulnerabilities, and be able to recognize and adjust to degraded signals. Aircraft should have additional navigation equipment for their intended route.\n\n\nGPS signals are vulnerable to intentional and unintentional interference from a wide variety of sources, including radars, microwave links, ionosphere effects, solar activity, multi-path error, satellite communications, GPS repeaters, and even some systems onboard the aircraft. In general, these types of unintentional interference are localized and intermittent. Of greater and growing concern is the intentional and unauthorized interference of GPS signals by persons using \u201cjammers\u201d or  \u201cspoofers\u201d to disrupt air navigation by interfering with the reception of valid satellite signals.\n\nNOTE-\nThe U.S. government regularly conducts GPS tests, training activities, and exercises that interfere with GPS signals. These events are geographically limited, coordinated, scheduled, and advertised via GPS and/or WAAS NOTAMS. Operators of GPS aircraft should always check for GPS and/or WAAS NOTAMS for their route of flight.\n\nGPS is a critical component of essential communication, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) in the NAS; and flight safety/control systems. Additionally, some satellite communications avionics use GPS signals for operations in oceanic and remote airspaces. It is the sole aircraft position-reporting source for Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B). Some business aircraft are using GPS as a reference source for aircraft flight control and stability systems. GPS is also a necessary component of the Aircraft Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) - an aircraft safety system that alerts pilots of upcoming terrain. There are examples of false \u201cterrain-pull up\" warnings during GPS anomalies.\n\nWhen flying IFR, pilots should have additional navigation equipment for their intended route to crosscheck their position. Routine checks of position against VOR or DME information, for example, could help detect a compromised GPS signal. Pilots transitioning to VOR navigation in response to GPS anomalies should refer to the Chart Supplement U.S. to identify airports with available conventional approaches associated with the VOR Minimum Operational Network (MON) program. (Reference 1-1-3f.)\n\nWhen flying GPS approaches, particularly in IMC, pilots should have a backup plan in the event of GPS anomalies. Although the appropriate response will vary with the situation, in general pilots should:\n\nMaintain control of the aircraft,\n\n\nUse the last reliable navigation information as the basis for initial headings, and climb above terrain,\n\nChange to another source of navigation, if available (i.e., VOR, DME radar vectors).\n\nContact ATC as soon as practical.\n\nPilots should promptly notify ATC if they experience GPS anomalies. Pilots should not normally inform ATC of GPS interference or outages when flying through a known NOTAMed testing area, unless they require ATC assistance. (See 1-1-13.)"

                "section-content": "Capabilities\n\nRadar is a method whereby radio waves are transmitted into the air and are then received when they have been reflected by an object in the path of the beam. Range is determined by measuring the time it takes (at the speed of light) for the radio wave to go out to the object and then return to the receiving antenna. The direction of a detected object from a radar site is determined by the position of the rotating antenna when the reflected portion of the radio wave is received.\n\n\nMore reliable maintenance and improved equipment have reduced radar system failures to a negligible factor. Most facilities actually have some components duplicated, one operating and another which immediately takes over when a malfunction occurs to the primary component.\n\n\nLimitations\n\nIt is very important for the aviation community to recognize the fact that there are limitations to radar service and that ATC controllers may not always be able to issue traffic advisories concerning aircraft which are not under ATC control and cannot be seen on radar. (See FIG 4-5-1.)\nFIG 4-5-1Limitations to Radar Service\n\nThe characteristics of radio waves are such that they normally travel in a continuous straight line unless they are:\n\n\u201cBent\u201d by abnormal atmospheric phenomena such as temperature inversions;\n\n\nReflected or attenuated by dense objects such as heavy clouds, precipitation, ground obstacles, mountains, etc.; or\n\nScreened by high terrain features.\n\n\nThe bending of radar pulses, often called anomalous propagation or ducting, may cause many extraneous blips to appear on the radar operator's display if the beam has been bent toward the ground or may decrease the detection range if the wave is bent upward. It is difficult to solve the effects of anomalous propagation, but using beacon radar and electronically eliminating stationary and slow moving targets by a method called moving target indicator (MTI) usually negate the problem.\n\nRadar energy that strikes dense objects will be reflected and displayed on the operator's scope thereby blocking out aircraft at the same range and greatly weakening or completely eliminating the display of targets at a greater range. Again, radar beacon and MTI are very effectively used to combat ground clutter and weather phenomena, and a method of circularly polarizing the radar beam will eliminate some weather returns. A negative characteristic of MTI is that an aircraft flying a speed that coincides with the canceling signal of the MTI (tangential or \u201cblind\u201d speed) may not be displayed to the radar controller.\n\nRelatively low altitude aircraft will not be seen if they are screened by mountains or are below the radar beam due to earth curvature. The historical solution to screening has been the installation of strategically placed multiple radars, which has been done in some areas, but ADS-B now provides ATC surveillance in some areas with challenging terrain where multiple radar installations would be impractical.\n\nThere are several other factors which affect radar control. The amount of reflective surface of an aircraft will determine the size of the radar return. Therefore, a small light airplane or a sleek jet fighter will be more difficult to see on primary radar than a large commercial jet or military bomber. Here again, the use of transponder or ADS-B equipment is invaluable. In addition, all FAA ATC facilities display automatically reported altitude information to the controller from appropriately equipped aircraft.\n\nAt some locations within the ATC en route environment, secondary-radar-only (no primary radar) gap filler radar systems are used to give lower altitude radar coverage between two larger radar systems, each of which provides both primary and secondary radar coverage. ADS-B serves this same role, supplementing both primary and secondary radar. In those geographical areas served by secondary radar only or ADS-B, aircraft without either transponders or ADS-B equipment cannot be provided with radar service. Additionally, transponder or ADS-B equipped aircraft cannot be provided with radar advisories concerning primary targets and ATC radar-derived weather.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nP/CG Term - RADAR.\n\n\nWith regard to air traffic radar reception, wind turbines generally do not affect the quality of air traffic surveillance radar returns for transponder and ADS-B Out equipped aircraft. Air traffic  interference issues apply to the search radar and Non-Transponder/Non-ADS-B Out equipped aircraft.\n\nNOTE-\nGenerally, one or two wind turbines don't present a significant radar reception loss. A rule of thumb is three (3) or more turbines constitute a wind turbine farm and thus negatively affect the search radar product.\n\nDetection loss in the area of a wind turbine farm is substantial. In extreme circumstances, this can extend for more than 1.0 nautical mile (NM) horizontally around the nearest turbine and at all altitudes above the wind turbine farm. (See FIG 4-5-2.)\nFIG 4-5-2Wind Turbine Farm Area of Potential Interference\n\nNOTE-\nAll aircraft should comply with 14 CFR \u00a791.119(c) \u201c\u2026aircraft may not be operated closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel, vehicle, or structure.\u201d\n\n\nTo avoid interference Non-Transponder/Non-ADS-B Out equipped aircraft should avoid flight within 1.0 NM horizontally, at all altitudes, from the wind turbine farms.\n\nBecause detection loss near and above wind turbine farms for search-only targets causes dropped tracks, erroneous tracks, and can result in loss of separation, it is imperative that Non-Transponder/Non-ADS-B Out equipped aircraft operate at the proper VFR altitudes per hemispheric rule and utilize see-and-avoid techniques.\n\nPilots should be aware that air traffic controllers cannot provide separation from Non-Transponder/Non-ADS-B Out equipped aircraft in the vicinity of wind turbine farms. See-and-avoid is the pilot's responsibility, as these non-equipped aircraft may not appear on radar and will not appear on the Traffic Information Services-Broadcast (TIS-B).\n\nThe controller's ability to advise a pilot flying on instruments or in visual conditions of the aircraft's proximity to another aircraft will be limited if the unknown aircraft is not observed on radar, if no flight plan information is available, or if the volume of traffic and workload prevent issuing traffic information. The controller's first priority is given to establishing vertical, lateral, or longitudinal separation between aircraft flying IFR under the control of ATC.\n\n\nFAA radar units operate continuously at the locations shown in the Chart Supplement, and their services are available to all pilots, both civil and military. Contact the associated FAA control tower or ARTCC on any frequency guarded for initial instructions, or in an emergency, any FAA facility for information on the nearest radar service."

                "section-content": "The ATCRBS, sometimes referred to as secondary surveillance radar, consists of three main components:\n\nInterrogator. Primary radar relies on a signal being transmitted from the radar antenna site and for this signal to be reflected or \u201cbounced back\u201d from an object (such as an aircraft). This reflected signal is then displayed as a \u201ctarget\u201d on the controller's radarscope. In the ATCRBS, the Interrogator, a ground based radar beacon transmitter-receiver, scans in synchronism with the primary radar and transmits discrete radio signals which repetitiously request all transponders, on the mode being used, to reply. The replies received are then mixed with the primary returns and both are displayed on the same radarscope.\n\n\nTransponder. This airborne radar beacon transmitter-receiver automatically receives the signals from the interrogator and selectively replies with a specific pulse group (code) only to those interrogations being received on the mode to which it is set. These replies are independent of, and much stronger than a primary radar return.\n\nRadarscope. The radarscope used by the controller displays returns from both the primary radar system and the ATCRBS. These returns, called targets, are what the controller refers to in the control and separation of traffic.\n\n\nThe job of identifying and maintaining identification of primary radar targets is a long and tedious task for the controller. Some of the advantages of ATCRBS over primary radar are:\n\nReinforcement of radar targets.\n\n\nRapid target identification.\n\nUnique display of selected codes.\n\nA part of the ATCRBS ground equipment is the decoder. This equipment enables a controller to assign discrete transponder codes to each aircraft under his/her control. Normally only one code will be assigned for the entire flight. Assignments are made by the ARTCC computer on the basis of the National Beacon Code Allocation Plan. The equipment is also designed to receive Mode C altitude information from the aircraft.\n\nNOTE-\nRefer to figures with explanatory legends for an illustration of the target symbology depicted on radar scopes in the NAS Stage A (en route), the ARTS III (terminal) Systems, and other nonautomated (broadband) radar systems.

Among the first FAA-provided data services, TIS is intended to improve the safety and efficiency of \u201csee and avoid\u201d flight through an automatic display that informs the pilot of nearby traffic and potential conflict situations. This traffic display is intended to assist the pilot in visual acquisition of these aircraft. TIS employs an enhanced capability of the terminal Mode S radar system, which contains the surveillance data, as well as the data link required to \u201cuplink\u201d this information to suitably-equipped aircraft (known as a TIS \u201cclient\u201d). TIS provides estimated position, altitude, altitude trend, and ground track information for up to 8 intruder aircraft within 7 NM horizontally, +3,500\u2009and -3,000 feet vertically of the client aircraft (see FIG 4-5-5, TIS Proximity Coverage Volume). The range of a target reported at a distance greater than 7\u2009NM only indicates that this target will be a threat within 34 seconds and does not display a precise distance. TIS will alert the pilot to aircraft (under surveillance of the Mode S radar) that are estimated to be within 34 seconds of potential collision, regardless of distance or altitude. TIS surveillance data is derived from the same radar used by ATC; this data is uplinked to the client aircraft on each radar scan (nominally every 5 seconds).\n\n\nRequirements.\n\nIn order to use TIS, the client and any intruder aircraft must be equipped with the appropriate cockpit equipment and fly within the radar coverage of a Mode S radar capable of providing TIS. Typically, this will be within 55 NM of the sites depicted in FIG 4-5-6, Terminal Mode S Radar Sites. ATC communication is not a requirement to receive TIS, although it may be required by the particular airspace or flight operations in which TIS is being used.\nFIG 4-5-5TIS Proximity Coverage Volume\nFIG 4-5-6Terminal Mode S Radar Sites\nFIG 4-5-7Traffic Information Service (TIS)\nAvionics Block Diagram\n\n\nThe cockpit equipment functionality required by a TIS client aircraft to receive the service consists of the following (refer to FIG 4-5-7):\n\nMode S data link transponder with altitude encoder.\n\n\nData link applications processor with TIS software installed.\n\nControl-display unit.\n\nOptional equipment includes a digital heading source to correct display errors caused by \u201ccrab angle\u201d and turning maneuvers.\n\nNOTE-\nSome of the above functions will likely be combined into single pieces of avionics, such as (a) and (b).\n\nTo be visible to the TIS client, the intruder aircraft must, at a minimum, have an operating transponder (Mode A, C or S). All altitude information provided by TIS from intruder aircraft is derived from Mode C reports, if appropriately equipped.\n\nTIS will initially be provided by the terminal Mode S systems that are paired with ASR-9 digital primary radars. These systems are in locations with the greatest traffic densities, thus will provide the greatest initial benefit. The remaining terminal Mode\u2009S sensors, which are paired with ASR-7 or ASR-8 analog primary radars, will provide TIS pending modification or relocation of these sites. See FIG 4-5-6, Terminal Mode S Radar Sites, for site locations. There is no mechanism in place, such as NOTAMs, to provide status update on individual radar sites since TIS is a nonessential, supplemental information service.\nThe FAA also operates en route Mode S radars (not illustrated) that rotate once every 12 seconds. These sites will require additional development of TIS before any possible implementation. There are no plans to implement TIS in the en route Mode S radars at the present time.\nCapabilities.\n\nTIS provides ground-based surveillance information over the Mode S data link to properly equipped client aircraft to aid in visual acquisition of proximate air traffic. The actual avionics capability of each installation will vary and the supplemental handbook material must be consulted prior to using TIS. A maximum of eight (8) intruder aircraft may be displayed; if more than eight aircraft match intruder parameters, the eight \u201cmost significant\u201d intruders are uplinked. These \u201cmost significant\u201d intruders are usually the ones in closest proximity and/or the greatest threat to the TIS client.\n\n\nTIS, through the Mode S ground sensor, provides the following data on each intruder aircraft:\n\nRelative bearing information in 6-degree increments.\n\n\nRelative range information in 1/8 NM to 1 NM increments (depending on range).\n\nRelative altitude in 100-foot increments (within 1,000 feet) or 500-foot increments (from 1,000-3,500 feet) if the intruder aircraft has operating altitude reporting capability.\n\nEstimated intruder ground track in 45-degree increments.\n\nAltitude trend data (level within 500 fpm or climbing/descending >500 fpm) if the intruder aircraft has operating altitude reporting capability.\n\nIntruder priority as either an \u201ctraffic advisory\u201d or \u201cproximate\u201d intruder.\n\nWhen flying from surveillance coverage of one Mode S sensor to another, the transfer of TIS is an automatic function of the avionics system and requires no action from the pilot.\n\nThere are a variety of status messages that are provided by either the airborne system or ground equipment to alert the pilot of high priority intruders and data link system status. These messages include the following:\n\nAlert. Identifies a potential collision hazard within 34 seconds. This alert may be visual and/or audible, such as a flashing display symbol or a headset tone. A target is a threat if the time to the closest approach in vertical and horizontal coordinates is less than 30 seconds and the closest approach is expected to be within 500 feet vertically and 0.5\u2009nautical miles laterally.\n\n\nTIS Traffic. TIS traffic data is displayed.\n\nCoasting. The TIS display is more than 6\u2009seconds old. This indicates a missing uplink from the ground system. When the TIS display information is more than 12 seconds old, the \u201cNo Traffic\u201d status will be indicated.\n\nNo Traffic. No intruders meet proximate or alert criteria. This condition may exist when the TIS system is fully functional or may indicate \u201ccoasting\u201d between 12 and 59 seconds old (see (c) above).\n\nTIS Unavailable. The pilot has requested TIS, but no ground system is available. This condition will also be displayed when TIS uplinks are missing for 60 seconds or more.\n\nTIS Disabled. The pilot has not requested TIS or has disconnected from TIS.\n\nGood-bye. The client aircraft has flown outside of TIS coverage.\n\nNOTE-\nDepending on the avionics manufacturer implementation, it is possible that some of these messages will not be directly available to the pilot.\n\nDepending on avionics system design, TIS may be presented to the pilot in a variety of different displays, including text and/or graphics. Voice annunciation may also be used, either alone or in combination with a visual display. FIG 4-5-7, Traffic Information Service (TIS), Avionics Block Diagram, shows an example of a TIS display using symbology similar to the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) installed on most passenger air carrier/commuter aircraft in the U.S. The small symbol in the center represents the client aircraft and the display is oriented \u201ctrack up,\u201d with the 12 o'clock position at the top. The range rings indicate 2 and 5\u2009NM. Each intruder is depicted by a symbol positioned at the approximate relative bearing and range from the client aircraft. The circular symbol near the center indicates an \u201calert\u201d intruder and the diamond symbols indicate \u201cproximate\u201d intruders.\n\nThe inset in the lower right corner of FIG 4-5-7, Traffic Information Service (TIS), Avionics Block Diagram, shows a possible TIS data block display. The following information is contained in this data block:\n\nThe intruder, located approximately four\u2009o'clock, three miles, is a \u201cproximate\u201d aircraft and currently not a collision threat to the client aircraft. This is indicated by the diamond symbol used in this example.\n\n\nThe intruder ground track diverges to the right of the client aircraft, indicated by the small arrow.\n\nThe intruder altitude is 700 feet less than or below the client aircraft, indicated by the \u201c-07\u201d located under the symbol.\n\nThe intruder is descending >500 fpm, indicated by the downward arrow next to the \u201c-07\u201d relative altitude information. The absence of this arrow when an altitude tag is present indicates level flight or a climb/descent rate less than 500 fpm.\n\nNOTE-\nIf the intruder did not have an operating altitude encoder (Mode C), the altitude and altitude trend \u201ctags\u201d would have been omitted.\n\nLimitations.\n\nTIS is NOT intended to be used as a collision avoidance system and does not relieve the pilot's responsibility to \u201csee and avoid\u201d other aircraft (see paragraph 5-5-8, See and Avoid). TIS must not be used for avoidance maneuvers during IMC or other times when there is no visual contact with the intruder aircraft. TIS is intended only to assist in visual acquisition of other aircraft in VMC. Avoidance maneuvers are neither provided nor authorized as a direct result of a TIS intruder display or TIS alert.\n\n\nWhile TIS is a useful aid to visual traffic avoidance, it has some system limitations that must be fully understood to ensure proper use. Many of  these limitations are inherent in secondary radar surveillance. In other words, the information provided by TIS will be no better than that provided to ATC. Other limitations and anomalies are associated with the TIS predictive algorithm.\n\nIntruder Display Limitations. TIS will only display aircraft with operating transponders installed. TIS relies on surveillance of the Mode S radar, which is a \u201csecondary surveillance\u201d radar similar to the ATCRBS described in paragraph\u20094-5-2.\n\n\nTIS Client Altitude Reporting Requirement. Altitude reporting is required by the TIS client aircraft in order to receive TIS. If the altitude encoder is inoperative or disabled, TIS will be unavailable, as TIS requests will not be honored by the ground system. As such, TIS requires altitude reporting to determine the Proximity Coverage Volume as indicated in FIG 4-5-5. TIS users must be alert to altitude encoder malfunctions, as TIS has no mechanism to determine if client altitude reporting is correct. A failure of this nature will cause erroneous and possibly unpredictable TIS operation. If this malfunction is suspected, confirmation of altitude reporting with ATC is suggested.\n\nIntruder Altitude Reporting. Intruders without altitude reporting capability will be displayed without the accompanying altitude tag. Additionally, nonaltitude reporting intruders are assumed to be at the same altitude as the TIS client for alert computations. This helps to ensure that the pilot will be alerted to all traffic under radar coverage, but the actual altitude difference may be substantial. Therefore, visual acquisition may be difficult in this instance.\n\nCoverage Limitations. Since TIS is provided by ground-based, secondary surveillance radar, it is subject to all limitations of that radar. If an aircraft is not detected by the radar, it cannot be displayed on TIS. Examples of these limitations are as follows:\n\nTIS will typically be provided within 55\u2009NM of the radars depicted in FIG 4-5-6, Terminal Mode S Radar Sites. This maximum range can vary by radar site and is always subject to \u201cline of sight\u201d limitations; the radar and data link signals will be blocked by obstructions, terrain, and curvature of the earth.\n\n\nTIS will be unavailable at low altitudes in many areas of the country, particularly in mountainous regions. Also, when flying near the \u201cfloor\u201d of radar coverage in a particular area, intruders below the client aircraft may not be detected by TIS.\n\nTIS will be temporarily disrupted when flying directly over the radar site providing coverage if no adjacent site assumes the service. A ground-based radar, similar to a VOR or NDB, has a zenith cone, sometimes referred to as the cone of confusion or cone of silence. This is the area of ambiguity directly above the station where bearing information is unreliable. The zenith cone setting for TIS is 34\u2009degrees:  Any aircraft above that angle with respect to the radar horizon will lose TIS coverage from that radar until it is below this 34 degree angle. The aircraft may not actually lose service in areas of multiple radar coverage since an adjacent radar will provide TIS. If no other TIS-capable radar is available, the \u201cGood-bye\u201d message will be received and TIS terminated until coverage is resumed.\n\nIntermittent Operations. TIS operation may be intermittent during turns or other maneuvering, particularly if the transponder system does not include antenna diversity (antenna mounted on the top and bottom of the aircraft). As in (d) above, TIS is dependent on two-way, \u201cline of sight\u201d communications between the aircraft and the Mode S radar.  Whenever the structure of the client aircraft comes between the transponder antenna (usually located on the underside of the aircraft) and the ground-based radar antenna, the signal may be temporarily interrupted.\n\nTIS Predictive Algorithm. TIS information is collected one radar scan prior to the scan during which the uplink occurs. Therefore, the surveillance information is approximately 5 seconds old. In order to present the intruders in a \u201creal time\u201d position, TIS uses a \u201cpredictive algorithm\u201d in its tracking software. This algorithm uses track history data to extrapolate intruders to their expected positions consistent with the time of display in the cockpit. Occasionally, aircraft maneuvering will cause this algorithm to induce errors in the TIS display. These errors primarily affect relative bearing information; intruder distance and altitude will remain relatively accurate and may be used to assist in \u201csee and avoid.\u201d Some of the more common examples of these errors are as follows:\n\nWhen client or intruder aircraft maneuver excessively or abruptly, the tracking algorithm will report incorrect horizontal position until the maneuvering aircraft stabilizes.\n\n\nWhen a rapidly closing intruder is on a course that crosses the client at a shallow angle (either overtaking or head on) and either aircraft abruptly changes course within \u00bc NM, TIS will display the intruder on the opposite side of the client than it actually is.\nThese are relatively rare occurrences and will be corrected in a few radar scans once the course has stabilized.\nHeading/Course Reference. Not all TIS aircraft installations will have onboard heading reference information. In these installations, aircraft course reference to the TIS display is provided by the Mode S radar. The radar only determines ground track information and has no indication of the client aircraft heading. In these installations, all intruder bearing information is referenced to ground track and does not account for wind correction. Additionally, since ground-based radar will require several scans to determine aircraft course following a course change, a lag in TIS display orientation (intruder aircraft bearing) will occur. As in (f) above, intruder distance and altitude are still usable.\n\nClosely-Spaced Intruder Errors.  When operating more than 30 NM from the Mode S sensor, TIS forces any intruder within 3/8 NM of the TIS client to appear at the same horizontal position as the client aircraft. Without this feature, TIS could display intruders in a manner confusing to the pilot in critical situations (for example, a closely-spaced intruder that is actually to the right of the client may appear on the TIS display to the left). At longer distances from the radar, TIS cannot accurately determine relative bearing/distance information on intruder aircraft that are in close proximity to the client.\nBecause TIS uses a ground-based, rotating radar for surveillance information, the accuracy of TIS data is dependent on the distance from the sensor (radar) providing the service. This is much the same phenomenon as experienced with ground-based navigational aids, such as a VOR. As distance from the radar increases, the accuracy of surveillance decreases. Since TIS does not inform the pilot of distance from the Mode S radar, the pilot must assume that any intruder appearing at the same position as the client aircraft may actually be up to 3/8 NM away in any direction. Consistent with the operation of TIS, an alert on the display (regardless of distance from the radar) should stimulate an outside visual scan, intruder acquisition, and traffic avoidance based on outside reference.\nReports of TIS Malfunctions.\n\nUsers of TIS can render valuable assistance in the early correction of malfunctions by reporting their observations of undesirable performance. Reporters should identify the time of observation, location, type and identity of aircraft, and describe the condition observed; the type of transponder processor, and software in use can also be useful information. Since TIS performance is monitored by maintenance personnel rather than ATC, it is suggested that malfunctions be reported by radio or telephone to the nearest Flight Service Station (FSS) facility.\n\nNOTE-\nTIS operates at only those terminal Mode S radar sites depicted in FIG 4-5-6. Though similar in some ways, TIS is not related to TIS-B (Traffic Information Service-Broadcast)."

                "section-content": "Introduction.\n\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is a surveillance technology deployed throughout the NAS (see FIG 4-5-8). The ADS-B system is composed of aircraft avionics and a ground infrastructure. Onboard avionics determine the position of the aircraft by using the GNSS and transmit its position along with additional information about the aircraft to ground stations for use by ATC and other ADS-B services. This information is transmitted at a rate of approximately once per second. (See FIG 4-5-9 and FIG 4-5-10.)\n\n\nIn the United States, ADS-B equipped aircraft exchange information on one of two frequencies: 978 or 1090 MHz. The 1090 MHz frequency is also associated with Mode A, C, and S transponder operations. 1090 MHz transponders with\u2009integrated ADS-B functionality extend the transponder message sets with additional ADS-B information. This additional information is known as\u2009an \u201cextended squitter\u201d message and is referred to as 1090ES. ADS-B equipment operating on 978 MHz is known as the Universal Access Transceiver (UAT).\n\nADS-B avionics can have the ability to both transmit and receive information. The transmission of ADS-B information from an aircraft is known as ADS-B Out. The receipt of ADS-B information by an aircraft is known as ADS-B In. All aircraft operating within the airspace defined in 14 CFR \u00a7\u200991.225 are required to transmit the information defined in \u00a7 91.227 using\u2009ADS-B Out avionics.\n\nIn general, operators flying at 18,000 feet and above (Class A airspace) are required to have 1090ES equipment. Those that do not fly above 18,000 may use either UAT or 1090ES equipment. (Refer to 14 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 91.225 and 91.227.) While the regulations do not require it, operators equipped with ADS-B In will realize additional benefits from ADS-B broadcast services: Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B) (paragraph 4-5-8) and Flight Information Service - Broadcast (FIS-B) (paragraph 4-5-9).\nFIG 4-5-8ADS-B, TIS-B, and FIS-B:\nBroadcast Services Architecture\n\n\nADS-B Certification and Performance Requirements.\nADS-B equipment may be certified as a surveillance source for air traffic separation services using ADS-B Out. ADS-B equipment may also be certified for use with ADS-B In advisory services that enable appropriately equipped aircraft to display\u2009traffic and flight information. Refer to the aircraft's flight manual supplement or Pilot Operating Handbook for the capabilities of a specific aircraft installation.\nADS-B Capabilities and Procedures.\n\nADS-B enables improved surveillance services, both air-to-air and air-to-ground, especially in areas where radar is ineffective due to terrain or where it is impractical or cost prohibitive. Initial NAS applications of air-to-air ADS-B are for \u201cadvisory\u201d use only, enhancing a pilot's visual acquisition of other nearby equipped aircraft either when airborne or on the airport surface. Additionally, ADS-B will enable ATC and fleet operators to monitor aircraft throughout the available ground station coverage area.\nFIG 4-5-9En Route - ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B/FIS-B Service Ceilings/Floors\nFIG 4-5-10Terminal - ADS-B/ADS-R/TIS-B/FIS-B Service Ceilings/Floors\n\n\nOne of the data elements transmitted by ADS-B is the aircraft's Flight Identification (FLT\u2009ID). The FLT ID is comprised of a maximum of seven alphanumeric characters and must correspond to the aircraft identification filed in the flight plan. For airline and commuter aircraft, the FLT ID is usually the company name and flight number (for example, AAL3432), and is typically entered into the avionics by the flight crew during preflight. For general aviation (GA), if aircraft avionics allow dynamic modification of the FLT ID, the pilot can enter it prior to flight. However, some ADS-B avionics require the FLT ID to be set to the aircraft registration number (for example, N1234Q) by the installer and cannot be changed by the pilot from the cockpit. In both cases, the FLT ID must correspond to the aircraft identification filed in its flight plan.\nATC automation systems use the transmitted ADS-B FLT ID to uniquely identify each aircraft within a given airspace, and to correlate it to its filed flight plan for the purpose of providing surveillance and separation services. If the FLT ID and the filed aircraft identification are not identical, a Call Sign Mis-Match (CSMM) is generated and ATC automation systems may not associate the aircraft with its filed flight plan. In this case, air traffic services may be delayed or unavailable until the CSMM is corrected. Consequently, it is imperative that flight crews and GA pilots ensure the FLT ID entry correctly matches the aircraft identification filed in their flight plan.\nEach ADS-B aircraft is assigned a unique ICAO address (also known as a 24-bit address) that is broadcast by the ADS-B transmitter. This ICAO address is programmed at installation. Should multiple aircraft broadcast the same ICAO address while transiting the same ADS-B Only Service Volume, the ADS-B network may be unable to track the targets correctly. If radar reinforcement is available, tracking will continue. If radar is unavailable, the controller may lose target tracking entirely on one or both targets. Consequently, it is imperative that the ICAO address entry is correct.\n\nAircraft that are equipped with ADS-B avionics on the UAT datalink have a feature that allows them to broadcast an anonymous 24-bit ICAO address. In this mode, the UAT system creates a randomized address that does not match the actual ICAO address assigned to the aircraft. The UAT anonymous 24-bit address feature may only be used when the operator has not filed an IFR flight plan and is not requesting ATC services. In the anonymity mode, the aircraft's beacon code must be set to 1200 and, depending on the manufacturer's implementation, the aircraft FLT ID might not be transmitted. Pilots should be aware that while in UAT anonymity mode, they will not be eligible to receive ATC separation and flight following services, and may not benefit from enhanced ADS-B search and rescue capabilities.\n\nADS-B systems integrated with the transponder will automatically set the applicable emergency status when 7500, 7600, or 7700 are entered into the transponder. ADS-B systems not integrated with the transponder, or systems with optional emergency codes, will require that the appropriate emergency code is entered through a pilot interface. ADS-B is intended for inflight and airport surface use. Unless otherwise directed by ATC, transponder/ADS-B systems should be turned \u201con\u201d and remain \u201con\u201d whenever operating in the air or on the airport surface movement area.\n\nATC Surveillance Services using ADS-B - Procedures and Recommended Phraseology\nRadar procedures, with the exceptions found in this paragraph, are identical to those procedures prescribed for radar in AIM Chapter 4 and Chapter 5.\nPreflight:\nIf ATC services are anticipated when either a VFR or IFR flight plan is filed, the aircraft identification (as entered in the flight plan) must be entered as the FLT\u2009ID in the ADS-B avionics.\n\nInflight:\nWhen requesting surveillance services while airborne, pilots must disable the anonymous feature, if so equipped, prior to contacting ATC. Pilots must also ensure that their transmitted ADS-B FLT ID matches the aircraft identification as entered in their flight plan.\nAircraft with an Inoperative/Malfunctioning ADS-B Transmitter:\n\nATC will inform the flight crew when the aircraft's ADS-B transmitter appears to be inoperative or malfunctioning:\n\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nYOUR ADS-B TRANSMITTER APPEARS TO BE INOPERATIVE/MALFUNCTIONING. STOP ADS-B TRANSMISSIONS.\n\n\nATC will inform the flight crew if it becomes necessary to turn off the aircraft's ADS-B transmitter.\n\nPHRASEOLOGY-\nSTOP ADS-B TRANSMISSIONS.\n\nOther malfunctions and considerations:\nLoss of automatic altitude reporting capabilities (encoder failure) will result in loss of ATC altitude advisory services.\nProcedures for Accommodation of Non-ADS-B Equipped Aircraft:\n\nPilots of aircraft not equipped with ADS-B may only operate outside airspace designated as ADS-B airspace in 14 CFR \u00a791.225. Pilots of unequipped aircraft wishing to fly any portion of a flight in ADS-B airspace may seek a deviation from the regulation to conduct operations without the required equipment. Direction for obtaining this deviation are available in Advisory Circular 90-114.\n\n\nWhile air traffic controllers can identify which aircraft are ADS-B equipped and which are not, there is no indication if a non-equipped pilot has obtained a preflight authorization to enter ADS-B airspace. Situations may occur when the pilot of a non-equipped aircraft, without an authorization to operate in ADS-B airspace receives an ATC-initiated in-flight clearance to fly a heading, route, or altitude that would penetrate ADS-B airspace. Such clearances may be for traffic, weather, or simply to shorten the aircraft's route of flight. When this occurs, the pilot should acknowledge and execute the clearance, but must advise the controller that they are not ADS-B equipped and have not received prior authorization to operate in ADS-B airspace. The controller, at their discretion, will either acknowledge and proceed with the new clearance, or modify the clearance to avoid ADS-B airspace. In either case, the FAA will normally not take enforcement action for non-equipage in these circumstances.\n\nNOTE-\nPilots operating without ADS-B equipment must not request route or altitude changes that will result in an incursion into ADS-B airspace except for safety of flight; for example, weather avoidance. Unequipped aircraft that have not received a pre-flight deviation authorization will only be considered in compliance with regulation if the amendment to flight is initiated by ATC.\n\nEXAMPLE-ATC:\u201cNovember Two Three Quebec, turn fifteen degrees left, proceed direct Bradford when able, rest of route unchanged.\u201d\nAircraft: \u201cNovember Two Three Quebec, turning fifteen degrees left, direct Bradford when able, rest of route unchanged.

(See paragraph 5-5-8, See and Avoid). ADS-B must not be used for avoidance maneuvers during IMC or other times when there is no visual contact with the intruder aircraft. ADS-B is intended only to assist in visual acquisition of other aircraft. No avoidance maneuvers are provided or authorized, as a direct result of an ADS-B target being displayed in the cockpit.\nReports of ADS-B Malfunctions.\nUsers of ADS-B can provide valuable assistance in the correction of malfunctions by reporting instances of undesirable system performance.

                "section-content": "Introduction\nTIS-B is the broadcast of ATC derived traffic information to ADS-B equipped (1090ES or UAT) aircraft from ground radio stations. The source of this traffic information is derived from ground-based\u2009air traffic surveillance sensors. TIS-B\u2009service will\u2009be available throughout the NAS where there are both adequate surveillance coverage from ground sensors and adequate broadcast coverage from ADS-B ground radio stations. The quality level of traffic information provided by TIS-B is dependent upon the number and type of ground sensors available as TIS-B sources and the timeliness\u2009of the reported data. (See FIG 4-5-9 and FIG 4-5-10.)\n\nTIS-B Requirements.\nIn order to receive TIS-B service, the following conditions must exist:\nAircraft must be equipped with an ADS-B transmitter/receiver or transceiver, and a cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI).\n\n\nAircraft must fly within the coverage volume of a compatible ground radio station that is configured for TIS-B uplinks. (Not all ground radio stations provide TIS-B due to a lack of radar coverage or because a radar feed is not available).\n\nAircraft must be within the coverage of and detected by at least one ATC radar serving the ground radio station in use.\n\nTIS-B Capabilities.\n\nTIS-B is intended to provide ADS-B equipped aircraft with a more complete traffic picture in situations where not all nearby aircraft are equipped with ADS-B Out. This advisory-only application is intended to enhance a pilot's visual acquisition of\u2009other traffic.\n\n\nOnly transponder-equipped targets (i.e.,\u2009Mode A/C or Mode S transponders) are transmitted through the ATC ground system architecture. Current radar siting may result in limited radar surveillance coverage at lower altitudes\u2009near some airports, with subsequently limited TIS-B service volume coverage. If there is no\u2009radar coverage in a given area, then there will be no TIS-B coverage in that area.\n\nTIS-B Limitations.\n\nTIS-B is NOT intended to be used as a collision avoidance system and does not relieve the pilot's responsibility to \u201csee and avoid\u201d other aircraft, in accordance with 14CFR \u00a791.113b. TIS-B must not\u2009be used for avoidance maneuvers during times when there is no visual contact with the intruder aircraft. TIS-B is intended only to assist in the visual acquisition of other aircraft.\n\nNOTE-\nNo aircraft avoidance maneuvers are authorized as a direct\u2009result of a TIS-B target being displayed in the cockpit.\n\n\nWhile TIS-B is a useful aid to visual traffic avoidance, its inherent system limitations must be understood to ensure proper use.\n\nA pilot may receive an intermittent TIS-B target of themselves, typically when maneuvering (e.g., climbing turns) due to the radar not tracking the\u2009aircraft as quickly as ADS-B.\n\n\nThe ADS-B-to-radar association process within the ground system may at times have difficulty correlating an ADS-B report with corresponding radar returns from the same aircraft. When this happens the pilot may see duplicate traffic symbols (i.e., \u201cTIS-B shadows\u201d) on the cockpit display.\n\nUpdates of TIS-B traffic reports will occur less often than ADS-B traffic updates. TIS-B position updates will occur approximately once every\u20093-13 seconds depending on the type of radar system in use within the coverage area. In comparison, the update rate for ADS-B is nominally once per second.\n\nThe TIS-B system only uplinks data pertaining to transponder-equipped aircraft. Aircraft without a transponder will not be displayed as TIS-B traffic.\n\nThere is no indication provided when any aircraft is operating inside or outside the TIS-B service volume, therefore it is difficult to know if one is receiving uplinked TIS-B traffic information.\n\nPilots and operators are reminded that the airborne equipment that displays TIS-B targets is for pilot situational awareness only and is not approved as a collision avoidance tool. Unless there is an imminent emergency requiring immediate action, any deviation from an air traffic control clearance in response to perceived converging traffic appearing on a TIS-B display must be approved by the controlling ATC facility before commencing the maneuver, except as permitted under certain conditions in 14CFR \u00a791.123. Uncoordinated deviations may place an aircraft in close proximity to other aircraft under ATC control not seen on the airborne equipment and may result in a pilot deviation or other incident.\n\nReports of TIS-B Malfunctions.\nUsers of TIS-B can provide valuable assistance in the correction of malfunctions by reporting instances of undesirable system performance. Since TIS-B performance is monitored by maintenance personnel rather than ATC, report malfunctions to the nearest Flight Service Station (FSS) facility by radio or telephone, or by sending an email to the ADS-B help desk at adsb@faa.gov. Reports should include:\nCondition observed;\n\n\nDate and time of observation;\n\nAltitude and location of observation;\n\nType and call sign of the aircraft; and\n\nType and software version of avionics system."

                "section-content": "Direct Communications, Controllers and Pilots.\n\nARTCCs are capable of direct communications with IFR air traffic on certain frequencies. Maximum communications coverage is possible through the use of Remote Center Air/Ground (RCAG) sites comprised of both VHF and UHF transmitters and receivers. These sites are located throughout the U.S. Although they may be several hundred miles away from the ARTCC, they are remoted to the various ARTCCs by land lines or microwave links. Since IFR operations are expedited through the use of direct communications, pilots are requested to use these frequencies strictly for communications pertinent to the control of IFR aircraft. Flight plan filing, en route weather, weather forecasts, and similar data should be requested through FSSs, company radio, or appropriate military facilities capable of performing these services.\n\n\nAn ARTCC is divided into sectors. Each sector is handled by one or a team of controllers and has its own sector discrete frequency. As a flight progresses from one sector to another, the pilot is requested to change to the appropriate sector discrete frequency.\n\nController Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) is a system that supplements air/ground voice communications. The CPDLC's principal operating criteria are:\n\nVoice remains the primary and controlling air/ground communications means.\n\n\nParticipating aircraft will need to have the appropriate CPDLC avionics equipment in order to receive uplink or transmit downlink messages.\n\nEn Route CPDLC Initial Services offer the following services: Altimeter Setting (AS), Transfer of Communications (TOC), Initial Contact (IC), and limited route assignments, including airborne reroutes (ABRR), limited altitude assignments, and emergency messages.\n\nAltimeter settings will be uplinked automatically when appropriate after a Monitor TOC. Altimeter settings will also be uplinked automatically when an aircraft receives an uplinked altitude assignment below FL 180. A controller may also manually send an altimeter setting message.\n\nNOTE-\nWhen conducting instrument approach procedures, pilots are responsible to obtain and use the appropriate altimeter setting in accordance with 14 CFR Section 97.20. CPDLC issued altimeter settings are excluded for this purpose.\n\n\nInitial contact is a safety validation transaction that compares a pilot's initiated altitude downlink message with an aircraft's stored altitude in the ATC automation system. When an IC mismatch or Confirm Assigned Altitude (CAA) downlink time-out indicator is displayed in the Full Data Block (FDB) and Aircraft List (ACL), the controller who has track control of the aircraft must use voice communication to verify the assigned altitude of the aircraft, and acknowledge the IC mismatch/time-out indicator.\n\nTransfer of communications automatically establishes data link contact with a succeeding sector.\n\nMenu text transmissions are scripted nontrajectory altering uplink messages.\n\nThe CPDLC Message Elements for the Initial Capabilities rollout are contained in TBL 5-3-1 through TBL 5-3-19, CPDLC Message Elements, below.\n\nNOTE-\nThe FAA is not implementing ATN B1; the ATN B1 column in the tables is there for informational purposes only.\n\n\nATC Frequency Change Procedures.\n\nThe following phraseology will be used by controllers to effect a frequency change:\n\nEXAMPLE-\n(Aircraft identification) contact (facility name or location name and terminal function) (frequency) at (time, fix, or altitude).\nNOTE-\nPilots are expected to maintain a listening watch on the transferring controller's frequency until the time, fix, or altitude specified.

Exact altitude or flight level reports on initial contact provide ATC with information required prior to using Mode C altitude information for separation purposes.\n\n\nWhen operating in a nonradar environment:\n\nOn initial contact, the pilot should inform the controller of the aircraft's present position, altitude and time estimate for the next reporting point.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n(Name) CENTER, (aircraft identification), (position), (altitude), ESTIMATING (reporting point) AT (time).\n\nAfter initial contact, when a position report will be made, the pilot should give the controller a complete position report.\n\nEXAMPLE-\n(Name) CENTER, (aircraft identification), (position), (time), (altitude), (type of flight plan), (ETA and name of next reporting point), (the name of the next succeeding reporting point), AND (remarks).\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 5-3-2, Position Reporting.\n\n\nAt times controllers will ask pilots to verify that they are at a particular altitude. The phraseology used will be: \u201cVERIFY AT (altitude).\u201d In climbing or descending situations, controllers may ask pilots to \u201cVERIFY ASSIGNED ALTITUDE AS (altitude).\u201d Pilots should confirm that they are at the altitude stated by the controller or that the assigned altitude is correct as stated. If this is not the case, they should inform the controller of the actual altitude being maintained or the different assigned altitude.\n\nCAUTION-\n \nPilots should not take action to change their actual altitude or different assigned altitude to the altitude stated in the controllers verification request unless the controller specifically authorizes a change.\n\nARTCC Radio Frequency Outage. ARTCCs normally have at least one back\u2010up radio receiver and transmitter system for each frequency, which can usually be placed into service quickly with little or no disruption of ATC service. Occasionally, technical problems may cause a delay but switchover seldom takes more than 60 seconds. When it appears that the outage will not be quickly remedied, the ARTCC will usually request a nearby aircraft, if there is one, to switch to the affected frequency to broadcast communications instructions. It is important, therefore, that the pilot wait at least 1 minute before deciding that the ARTCC has actually experienced a radio frequency failure. When such an outage does occur, the pilot should, if workload and equipment capability permit, maintain a listening watch on the affected frequency while attempting to comply with the following recommended communications procedures:\n\nIf two\u2010way communications cannot be established with the ARTCC after changing frequencies, a pilot should attempt to recontact the transferring controller for the assignment of an alternative frequency or other instructions.\n\n\nWhen an ARTCC radio frequency failure occurs after two\u2010way communications have been established, the pilot should attempt to reestablish contact with the center on any other known ARTCC frequency, preferably that of the next responsible sector when practicable, and ask for instructions. However, when the next normal frequency change along the route is known to involve another ATC facility, the pilot should contact that facility, if feasible, for instructions. If communications cannot be reestablished by either method, the pilot is expected to request communications instructions from the FSS appropriate to the route of flight.\n\nNOTE-\nThe exchange of information between an aircraft and an ARTCC through an FSS is quicker than relay via company radio because the FSS has direct interphone lines to the responsible ARTCC sector. Accordingly, when circumstances dictate a choice between the two, during an ARTCC frequency outage, relay via FSS radio is recommended.\n\nOakland Oceanic FIR. The use of CPDLC and ADS-C in the Oakland Oceanic FIR (KZAK) is only permitted by Inmarsat and Iridium customers. All other forms of data link connectivity are not authorized. Users must ensure that the proper data link code is filed in Item 10a of the ICAO FPL in order to indicate which satellite medium(s) the aircraft is equipped with. The identifier for Inmarsat is J5 and the identifier for Iridium is J7. If J5 or J7 is not included in the ICAO FPL, then the LOGON will be rejected by KZAK and the aircraft will not be able to connect.\n\nNew York Oceanic FIR.

The mean of these two times should then be taken as the actual time over the fix.\n\nIf a position is given with respect to distance and direction from a reporting point, the distance and direction should be computed as accurately as possible.\n\nExcept for terminal area transition purposes, position reports or navigation with reference to aids not established for use in the structure in which flight is being conducted will not normally be required by ATC.\n\n\nPosition Reporting Points. CFRs require pilots to maintain a listening watch on the appropriate frequency and, unless operating under the provisions of subparagraph c, to furnish position reports passing certain reporting points. Reporting points are indicated by symbols on en route charts. The designated compulsory reporting point symbol is a solid triangle  and the \u201con request\u201d reporting point symbol is the open triangle . Reports passing an \u201con request\u201d reporting point are only necessary when requested by ATC.\n\nPosition Reporting Requirements.\n\nFlights Along Airways or Routes.

Regardless of the altitude or flight level being flown, including flights operating in accordance with an ATC clearance specifying \u201cVFR-on-top,\u201d pilots must report over each reporting point used in the flight plan to define the route of flight.\n\nFlights in a Radar Environment. When informed by ATC that their aircraft are in \u201cRadar Contact,\u201d pilots should discontinue position reports over designated reporting points. They should resume normal position reporting when ATC advises \u201cRADAR CONTACT LOST\u201d or \u201cRADAR SERVICE TERMINATED.\u201d\n\nFlights in an Oceanic (Nonradar) Environment. Pilots must report over each point used in the flight plan to define the route of flight, even if the point is depicted on aeronautical charts as an \u201con request\" (non-compulsory) reporting point. For aircraft providing automatic position reporting via an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Contract (ADS-C) logon, pilots should discontinue voice position reports.\n\nNOTE-ATC will inform pilots that they are in \u201cradar contact\u201d:\n\n\nwhen their aircraft is initially identified in the ATC system; and\nwhen radar identification is reestablished after radar service has been terminated or radar contact lost.\n\n\nSubsequent to being advised that the controller has established radar contact, this fact will not be repeated to the pilot when handed off to another controller. At times, the aircraft identity will be confirmed by the receiving controller; however, this should not be construed to mean that radar contact has been lost. The identity of transponder equipped aircraft will be confirmed by asking the pilot to \u201cident,\u201d \u201csquawk standby,\u201d or to change codes. Aircraft without transponders will be advised of their position to confirm identity. In this case, the pilot is expected to advise the controller if in disagreement with the position given. Any pilot who cannot confirm the accuracy of the position given because of not being tuned to the NAVAID referenced by the controller, should ask for another radar position relative to the tuned in NAVAID.\nPosition Report Items:\n\nPosition reports should include the following items:\n\nIdentification;\n\n\nPosition;\n\nTime;\n\nAltitude or flight level (include actual altitude or flight level when operating on a clearance specifying VFR-on-top);\n\nType of flight plan (not required in IFR position reports made directly to ARTCCs or approach control);\n\nETA and name of next reporting point;\n\nThe name only of the next succeeding reporting point along the route of flight; and\n\nPertinent remarks."

                "section-content": "Three fixed route systems are established for air navigation purposes. They are the Federal airway system (consisting of VOR and L/MF routes), the jet route system, and the RNAV route system. To the extent possible, these route systems are aligned in an overlying manner to facilitate transition between each.\n\nThe VOR and L/MF (nondirectional radio beacons) Airway System consists of airways designated from 1,200 feet above the surface (or in some instances higher) up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL. These airways are depicted on IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts.\n\nNOTE-\nThe altitude limits of a victor airway should not be exceeded except to effect transition within or between route structures.\n\nExcept in Alaska, the VOR airways are: predicated solely on VOR or VORTAC navigation aids; depicted in black on aeronautical charts; and identified by a \u201cV\u201d (Victor) followed by the airway number (for example, V12).\n\nNOTE-\nSegments of VOR airways in Alaska are based on L/MF navigation aids and charted in brown instead of black on en route charts.\n\nA segment of an airway which is common to two or more routes carries the numbers of all the airways which coincide for that segment. When such is the case, pilots filing a flight plan need to indicate only that airway number for the route filed.\n\nNOTE-\nA pilot who intends to make an airway flight, using VOR facilities, will simply specify the appropriate \u201cvictor\u201d airway(s) in the flight plan. For example, if a flight is to be made from Chicago to New Orleans at 8,000 feet, using omniranges only, the route may be indicated as \u201cdeparting from Chicago-Midway, cruising 8,000 feet via Victor 9 to Moisant International.\u201d If flight is to be conducted in part by means of L/MF navigation aids and in part on omniranges, specifications of the appropriate airways in the flight plan will indicate which types of facilities will be used along the described routes, and, for IFR flight, permit ATC to issue a traffic clearance accordingly. A route may also be described by specifying the station over which the flight will pass, but in this case since many VORs and L/MF aids have the same name, the pilot must be careful to indicate which aid will be used at a particular location. This will be indicated in the route of flight portion of the flight plan by specifying the type of facility to be used after the location name in the following manner: Newark L/MF, Allentown VOR.\n\n\nWith respect to position reporting, reporting points are designated for VOR Airway Systems. Flights using Victor Airways will report over these points unless advised otherwise by ATC.\n\n\nThe L/MF airways (colored airways) are predicated solely on L/MF navigation aids and are depicted in brown on aeronautical charts and are identified by color name and number (e.g., Amber One). Green and Red airways are plotted east and west. Amber and Blue airways are plotted north and south.\n\nThe use of TSO-C145 (as revised) or TSO-C146 (as revised) GPS/WAAS navigation systems is allowed in Alaska as the only means of navigation on published air traffic service (ATS) routes, including those Victor, T-Routes, and colored airway segments designated with a second minimum en route altitude (MEA) depicted in blue and followed by the letter G at those lower altitudes. The altitudes so depicted are below the minimum reception altitude (MRA) of the land-based navigation facility defining the route segment, and guarantee standard en route obstacle clearance and two-way communications. Air carrier operators requiring operations specifications are authorized to conduct operations on those routes in accordance with FAA operations specifications.\n\n\nThe jet route system consists of jet routes established from 18,000 feet MSL to FL 450 inclusive.\n\nThese routes are depicted on Enroute High Altitude Charts. Jet routes are depicted in black on aeronautical charts and are identified by a \u201cJ\u201d (Jet) followed by the airway number (e.g., J12). Jet routes, as VOR airways, are predicated solely on VOR or VORTAC navigation facilities (except in Alaska).\n\nNOTE-\nSegments of jet routes in Alaska are based on L/MF navigation aids and are charted in brown color instead of black on en route charts.\n\n\nWith respect to position reporting, reporting points are designated for jet route systems. Flights using jet routes will report over these points unless otherwise advised by ATC.\n\nArea Navigation (RNAV) Routes.\n\nPublished RNAV routes, including Q-routes, T-routes, and Y-routes, can be flight planned for use by aircraft with RNAV capability, subject to any limitations or requirements noted on en route charts, in applicable Advisory Circulars, NOTAMs, etc. RNAV routes are normally depicted in blue on aeronautical charts and are identified by the letter \u201cQ,\u201d \u201cT,\u201d or \u201cY\u201d followed by the airway number (for example, Q13, T205, and Y280). Published RNAV routes are RNAV 2 except when specifically charted as RNAV 1. Unless otherwise specified, these routes require system performance currently met by GPS, GPS/WAAS, or DME/DME/IRU RNAV systems that satisfy the criteria discussed in AC 90-100A, U.S. Terminal and En Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations.\n\nQ-routes are available for use by RNAV equipped aircraft between 18,000 feet MSL and FL\u2009450 inclusive. Q-routes are depicted on Enroute High Altitude Charts.\n\nNOTE-\nAircraft in Alaska may only operate on GNSS Q-routes with\u2009GPS (TSO-C129 (as revised) or TSO-C196 (as revised)) equipment while the aircraft remains in Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar surveillance or with GPS/WAAS which does not require ATC radar surveillance.\n\n\nT-routes are available for use by GPS or GPS/WAAS equipped aircraft from 1,200 feet above the surface (or in some instances higher) up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL. T-routes are depicted on Enroute Low Altitude Charts.\n\nNOTE-\nAircraft in Alaska may only operate on GNSS T-routes with\u2009GPS/WAAS (TSO-C145 (as revised) or TSO-C146 (as revised)) equipment.\n\nY-routes generally run in U.S. offshore airspace, however operators can find some Y-routes over southern Florida. Pilots must use GPS for navigation and meet RNAV 2 performance requirements for all flights on Y-routes. Operators can find additional Y-route requirements in the U.S. Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), ENR 7.10, available on the FAA website.\n\n\nUnpublished RNAV routes are direct routes, based on area navigation capability, between waypoints defined in terms of latitude/longitude coordinates, degree-distance fixes, or offsets from established routes/airways at a specified distance and direction. Radar monitoring by ATC is required on all unpublished RNAV routes, except for GNSS-equipped aircraft cleared via filed published waypoints recallable from the aircraft's navigation database.\n\nMagnetic Reference Bearing (MRB) is the published bearing between two waypoints on an RNAV/GPS/GNSS route. The MRB is calculated by applying magnetic variation at the waypoint to the calculated true course between two waypoints. The MRB enhances situational awareness by indicating a reference bearing (no-wind heading) that a pilot should see on the compass/HSI/RMI, etc., when turning prior to/over a waypoint en route to another waypoint. Pilots should use this bearing as a reference only, because their RNAV/GPS/GNSS navigation system will fly the true course between the waypoints.\n\n\nOperation above FL 450 may be conducted on a point\u2010to\u2010point basis. Navigational guidance is provided on an area basis utilizing those facilities depicted on the enroute high altitude charts.\n\nRadar Vectors. Controllers may vector aircraft within controlled airspace for separation purposes, noise abatement considerations, when an operational advantage will be realized by the pilot or the controller, or when requested by the pilot. Vectors outside of controlled airspace will be provided only on pilot request. Pilots will be advised as to what the vector is to achieve when the vector is controller initiated and will take the aircraft off a previously assigned nonradar route. To the extent possible, aircraft operating on RNAV routes will be allowed to remain on their own navigation.\n\nWhen flying in Canadian airspace, pilots are cautioned to review Canadian Air Regulations.\n\nSpecial attention should be given to the parts which differ from U.S. CFRs.\n\nThe Canadian Airways Class B airspace restriction is an example. Class B airspace is all controlled low level airspace above 12,500 feet MSL or the MEA, whichever is higher, within which only IFR and controlled VFR flights are permitted. (Low level airspace means an airspace designated and defined as such in the Designated Airspace Handbook.)\n\n\nUnless issued a VFR flight clearance by ATC, regardless of the weather conditions or the height of the terrain, no person may operate an aircraft under VMC within Class B airspace.\n\nThe requirement for entry into Class B airspace is a student pilot permit (under the guidance or control of a flight instructor).\n\nVFR flight requires visual contact with the ground or water at all times.\n\n\nSegments of VOR airways and high level routes in Canada are based on L/MF navigation aids and are charted in brown color instead of blue on en\u2009route charts.\nFIG 5-3-1Adhering to Airways or Routes"

Each course change consists of variables that make the technique applicable in each case a matter only the pilot can resolve. Some variables which must be considered are turn radius, wind effect, airspeed, degree of turn, and cockpit instrumentation. An early turn, as illustrated below, is one method of adhering to airways or routes. The use of any available cockpit instrumentation, such as Distance Measuring Equipment, may be used by the pilot to lead the turn when making course changes. This is consistent with the intent of 14 CFR Section 91.181, which requires pilots to operate along the centerline of an airway and along the direct course between navigational aids or fixes.\n\n\nTurns which begin at or after fix passage may exceed airway or route boundaries. FIG 5-3-1 contains an example flight track depicting this, together with an example of an early turn.\n\nWithout such actions as leading a turn, aircraft operating in excess of 290 knots true air speed (TAS) can exceed the normal airway or route boundaries depending on the amount of course change required, wind direction and velocity, the character of the turn fix (DME, overhead navigation aid, or intersection), and the pilot's technique in making a course change. For example, a flight operating at 17,000 feet MSL with a TAS of 400 knots, a 25 degree bank, and a course change of more than 40 degrees would exceed the width of the airway or route; i.e., 4 nautical miles each side of centerline. However, in the airspace below 18,000 feet MSL, operations in excess of 290\u2009knots TAS are not prevalent and the provision of additional IFR separation in all course change situations for the occasional aircraft making a turn in excess of 290 knots TAS creates an unacceptable waste of airspace and imposes a penalty upon the preponderance of traffic which operate at low speeds. Consequently, the FAA expects pilots to lead turns and take other actions they consider necessary during course changes to adhere as closely as possible to the airways or route being flown."

The COP is a point along the route or airway segment between two adjacent navigation facilities or waypoints where changeover in navigation guidance should occur. At this point, the pilot should change navigation receiver frequency from the station behind the aircraft to the station ahead.\n\n\nThe COP is normally located midway between the navigation facilities for straight route segments, or at the intersection of radials or courses forming a dogleg in the case of dogleg route segments. When the COP is NOT located at the midway point, aeronautical charts will depict the COP location and give the mileage to the radio aids.\n\nCOPs are established for the purpose of preventing loss of navigation guidance, to prevent frequency interference from other facilities, and to prevent use of different facilities by different aircraft in the same airspace. Pilots are urged to observe COPs to the fullest extent."

This procedure will eliminate the possibility of an aircraft entering a holding pattern other than that desired by ATC. If unable to obtain holding instructions prior to reaching the fix (due to frequency congestion, stuck microphone, etc.), then enter a standard pattern on the course on which the aircraft approached the fix and request further clearance as soon as possible.

Holding protected airspace is designed based in part on pilot compliance with the three recommended holding pattern entry procedures discussed below. Deviations from these recommendations, coupled with excessive airspeed crossing the holding fix, may in some cases result in the aircraft exceeding holding protected airspace. (See FIG 5-3-4.)\n\nParallel Procedure. When approaching the holding fix from anywhere in sector (a), the parallel entry procedure would be to turn to a heading to parallel the holding course outbound on the nonholding side for one minute, turn in the direction of the holding pattern through more than 180 degrees, and return to the holding fix or intercept the holding course inbound.\n\n\nTeardrop Procedure. When approaching the holding fix from anywhere in sector (b), the teardrop entry procedure would be to fly to the fix, turn outbound to a heading for a 30 degree teardrop entry within the pattern (on the holding side) for a period of one minute, then turn in the direction of the holding pattern to intercept the inbound holding course.\n\nDirect Entry Procedure. When approaching the holding fix from anywhere in sector\u2009(c), the direct entry procedure would be to fly directly to the fix and turn to follow the holding pattern.\n\nWhile other entry procedures may enable the aircraft to enter the holding pattern and remain within protected airspace, the parallel, teardrop and direct entries are the procedures for entry and holding recommended by the FAA, and were derived as part of the development of the size and shape of the obstacle protection areas for holding.\n\nNonstandard Holding Pattern. Fix end and outbound end turns are made to the left. Entry procedures to a nonstandard pattern are oriented in relation to the 70 degree line on the holding side just as in the standard pattern.\n\nTiming.\n\nInbound Leg.\n\nAt or below 14,000 feet MSL: 1 minute.\n\n\nAbove 14,000 feet MSL: 11/2 minutes.\n\nNOTE-\nThe initial outbound leg should be flown for 1 minute or 1\u20091/2 minutes (appropriate to altitude). Timing for subsequent outbound legs should be adjusted, as necessary, to achieve proper inbound leg time. Pilots may use any navigational means available; i.e., DME, RNAV, etc., to ensure the appropriate inbound leg times.\n\n\nOutbound leg timing begins over/abeam the fix, whichever occurs later. If the abeam position cannot be determined, start timing when turn to outbound is completed.\n\nDistance Measuring Equipment (DME)/ GPS Along-Track Distance (ATD). DME/GPS holding is subject to the same entry and holding procedures except that distances (nautical miles) are used in lieu of time values. The outbound course of the DME/GPS holding pattern is called the outbound leg of the pattern. The controller or the instrument approach procedure chart will specify the length of the outbound leg. The end of the outbound leg is determined by the DME or ATD readout. The holding fix on conventional procedures, or controller defined holding based on a conventional navigation aid with DME, is a specified course or radial and distances are from the DME station for both the inbound and outbound ends of the holding pattern. When flying published GPS overlay or stand alone procedures with distance specified, the holding fix will be a waypoint in the database and the end of the outbound leg will be determined by the ATD. Some GPS overlay and early stand alone procedures may have timing specified. (See FIG 5-3-5, FIG 5-3-6 and FIG 5-3-7.) See paragraph 1-1-17, Global Positioning System (GPS), for requirements and restriction on using GPS for IFR operations.\nFIG 5-3-5Inbound Toward NAVAID\n\nNOTE-\nWhen the inbound course is toward the NAVAID, the fix distance is 10 NM, and the leg length is 5 NM, then the end of the outbound leg will be reached when the DME reads 15 NM.\nFIG 5-3-6Inbound Leg Away from NAVAID\n\nNOTE-\nWhen the inbound course is away from the NAVAID and the fix distance is 28 NM, and the leg length is 8 NM, then the end of the outbound leg will be reached when the DME reads 20 NM.\n\nUse of RNAV Distance in lieu of DME Distance. Substitution of RNAV computed distance to or from a NAVAID in place of DME distance is permitted when holding. However, the actual holding location and pattern flown will be further from the NAVAID than designed due to the lack of slant range in the position solution (see FIG 5-3-7). This may result in a slight difference between RNAV distance readout in reference to the NAVAID and the DME readout, especially at higher altitudes. When used solely for DME substitution, the difference between RNAV distance to/from a fix and DME slant range distance can be considered negligible and no pilot action is required.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nAIM, Para 1-2-3, Use of Suitable Area Navigation (RNAV) Systems on Conventional Procedures and Routes.\n\nFIG 5-3-7Difference Between DME Distance From NAVAID & RNAV Computed Distance From NAVAID\nUse of RNAV Guidance and Holding. RNAV systems, including multi-sensor Flight Management Systems (FMS) and stand-alone GPS receivers, may be used to furnish lateral guidance when executing a hold. The manner in which holding is implemented in an RNAV system varies widely between aircraft and RNAV system manufacturers. Holding pattern data may be extracted from the RNAV database for published holds or may be manually entered for ad-hoc ATC-assigned holds. Pilots are expected to be familiar with the capabilities and limitations of the specific RNAV system used for holding.\n\nAll holding, including holding defined on an RNAV or RNP procedure, is based on the conventional NAVAID holding design criteria, including the holding protected airspace construction. There are differences between the holding entry and flight track assumed in conventional holding pattern design and the entry and track that may be flown when RNAV guidance is used to execute holding. Individually, these differences may not affect the ability of the aircraft to remain within holding pattern protected airspace. However, cumulatively, they can result in deviations sufficient to result in excursions up to limits of the holding pattern protected airspace, and in some circumstances beyond protected airspace. The following difference and considerations apply when an RNAV system furnishes the lateral guidance used to fly a holding pattern:\n\nMany systems use ground track angle instead of heading to select the entry method. While the holding pattern design allows a 5 degree tolerance, this may result in an unexpected entry when the winds induce a large drift angle.\n\n\nThe holding protected airspace is based on the assumption that the aircraft will fly-over the holding fix upon initial entry. RNAV systems may execute a \u201cfly-by\u201d turn when approaching the holding fix prior to entry. A \u201cfly-by\u201d turn during a direct entry from the holding pattern side of holding course may result in excursions beyond protected airspace, especially as the intercept angle and ground speed increase.\n\nDuring holding, RNAV systems furnish lateral steering guidance using either a constant bank or constant radius to achieve the desired inbound and outbound turns. An aircraft's flight guidance system may use reduced bank angles for all turns including turns in holding, especially at higher altitudes, that may result in exceeding holding protected airspace. Use of a shallower bank angle will expand both the width and length of the aircraft track, especially as wind speed increases. If the flight guidance system's bank angle limit feature is pilot-selectable, a minimum 25 degree bank angle should be selected regardless of altitude unless aircraft operating limitations specify otherwise and the pilot advises ATC.\n\nWhere a holding distance is published, the turn from the outbound leg begins at the published distance from the holding fix, thus establishing the design turn point required to remain within protected airspace. RNAV systems apply a database coded or pilot-entered leg distance as a maximum length of the inbound leg to the holding fix. The RNAV system then calculates a turn point from the outbound leg required to achieve this inbound leg length. This often results in an RNAV-calculated turn point on the outbound leg beyond the design turn point. (See FIG 5-3-8). With a strong headwind against the outbound leg, RNAV systems may fly up to and possibly beyond the limits of protected airspace before turning inbound. (See FIG 5-3-9.) This is especially true at higher altitudes where wind speeds are greater and ground speed results in a wider holding pattern.\nFIG 5-3-8RNAV Lateral Guidance and Holding - No Wind\nFIG 5-3-9RNAV Lateral Guidance and Holding - Effect of Wind\n\nSome RNAV systems compute the holding pattern based on the aircraft's altitude and speed at a point prior to entering the hold. If the indicated airspeed is not reduced to comply with the maximum holding speed before this point, the computed pattern may exceed the protected airspace. Loading or executing a holding pattern may result in the speed and time limits applicable to the aircraft's current altitude being used to define the holding pattern for RNAV lateral guidance. This may result in an incorrect hold being flown by the RNAV system. For example, entering or executing the holding pattern above 14,000 feet when intending to hold below 14,000 feet may result in applying 1 \u00bd  minute timing below 14,000 feet.\n\nNOTE-\nSome systems permit the pilot to modify leg time of  holding patterns defined in the navigation database; for example, a hold-in-lieu of procedure turn. In most RNAV systems, the holding pattern time remains at the pilot-modified time and will not revert back to the coded time if the aircraft descends to a lower altitude where a shorter time interval applies.\n\n\nRNAV systems are not able to alert the pilot for excursions outside of holding pattern protected airspace since the dimensions of this airspace are not included in the navigation database. In addition, the dimensions of holding pattern protected airspace vary with altitude for a charted holding pattern, even when the hold is used for the same application. Close adherence to the pilot actions described in this section reduce the likelihood of exceeding the boundary of holding pattern protected airspace when using RNAV lateral guidance to conduct holding.\n\nHolding patterns may be stored in the RNAV system's navigation database and include coding with parameters defining how the RNAV system will conduct the hold. For example, coding will determine whether holding is conducted to manual termination (HM), continued holding until the aircraft reaches a specified altitude (HA), or holding is conducted until the holding fix is crossed the first time after entry (HF). Some systems do not store all holding patterns, and may only store patterns associated with missed approaches and hold-in-lieu of procedure turn (HILPT). Some store all holding as standard patterns and require pilot action to conduct non-standard holding (left turns).\n\nPilots are cautioned that multiple holding patterns may be established at the same fix. These holding patterns may differ in respect to turn directions and leg lengths depending on their application as an en route holding pattern, a holding pattern charted on a SID or STAR, or when used on an instrument approach procedure. Many RNAV systems limit the database coding at a particular fix to a single holding pattern definition. Pilots extracting the holding pattern from the navigation database are responsible for confirming that the holding pattern conforms to the assigned charted holding pattern in terms of turn direction, speed limit, timing, and distance.\n\n\nIf ATC assigns holding that is not charted, then the pilot is responsible for programming the RNAV system with the assigned holding course, turn direction, speed limit, leg length, or leg time.\n\nChanges made after the initial execution may not apply until the next circuit of the holding pattern if the aircraft is in close proximity to the holding fix.\n\nPilot Action. The following actions are recommended to ensure that the aircraft remains within holding protected airspace when holding is performed using either conventional NAVAID guidance or when using RNAV lateral guidance.\n\nSpeed. When ATC furnishes advance notice of holding, start speed reduction to be at or below the maximum holding speed allowed at least 3 minutes prior to crossing the holding fix. If advance notice by ATC is not provided, begin speed reduction as expeditiously as practical. It is acceptable to allow RNAV systems to determine an appropriate deceleration point prior to the holding fix and to manage the speed reduction to the RNAV computed holding speed. If the pilot does not permit the RNAV system to manage the deceleration from the computed point, the actual hold pattern size at holding entry may differ from the holding pattern size computed by the RNAV system.\n\nAircraft are expected to enter holding at or below the maximum holding speed established in paragraph 5-3-8j2(a) or the charted maximum holding speed.\n\nAll fixed wing aircraft conducting holding should fly at speeds at or above 90 KIAS to minimize the influence of wind drift.\n\n\nWhen RNAV lateral guidance is used in fixed wing airplanes, it is desirable to enter and conduct holding at the lowest practical airspeed consistent with the airplane's recommended holding speed to address the cumulative errors associated with RNAV holding and increase the probability of remaining within protected airspace. It is acceptable to allow RNAV systems to determine a recommended holding speed that is at or below the maximum holding speed. \n\nHelicopter holding is based on a minimum airspeed of 90 KIAS.\n\n\nAdvise ATC immediately if unable to comply with the maximum holding airspeed and request an alternate clearance.\n\nNOTE-\nSpeeds above the maximum or published holding speed may be necessary due to turbulence, icing, etc. Exceeding maximum holding airspeed may result in aircraft excursions beyond the holding pattern protected airspace. In a non-radar environment, the pilot should advise ATC that they cannot accept the assigned hold.\n\nEnsure the RNAV system applies the proper time and speed restrictions to a holding pattern. This is especially critical when climbing or descending to a holding pattern altitude where time and speed restrictions are different than at the present aircraft altitude.\n\n\nBank Angle. For holding not involving the use of RNAV lateral guidance, make all turns during entry and while holding at:\n\n3 degrees per second, or\n\n\n30 degree bank angle, or\n\n25 degree bank angle, provided a flight director system is used.\n\nNOTE-\nUse whichever requires the least bank angle.\n\nWhen using RNAV lateral guidance to conduct holding, it is acceptable to permit the RNAV system to calculate the appropriate bank angle for the outbound and inbound turns. Do not use flight guidance system bank angle limiting functions of less than 25 degrees unless the feature is not pilot-selectable, required by the aircraft limitations, or its use is necessary to comply with the aircraft's minimum maneuvering speed margins. If the bank angle must be limited to less than 25 degrees, advise ATC that additional area for holding is required.\n\nCompensate for wind effect primarily by drift correction on the inbound and outbound legs. When outbound, triple the inbound drift correction to avoid major turning adjustments; for example, if correcting left by 8 degrees when inbound, correct right by 24 degrees when outbound.\n\nDetermine entry turn from aircraft heading upon arrival at the holding fix; +/- 5 degrees in heading is considered to be within allowable good operating limits for determining entry. When using RNAV lateral guidance for holding, it is permissible to allow the system to compute the holding entry.\n\nRNAV lateral guidance may execute a fly-by turn beginning at an excessively large distance from the holding fix. Reducing speed to the maximum holding speed at least 3 minutes prior to reaching the holding fix and using the recommended 25 degree bank angle will reduce potential excursions beyond protected airspace.\n\nWhen RNAV guidance is used for holding, pilots should be prepared to intervene if the turn from outbound leg to the inbound leg does not begin within a reasonable distance of the charted leg length, especially when holding is used as a course reversal HILPT. Pilot intervention is not required when holding in an ATC-assigned holding pattern that is not charted. However, notify ATC when the outbound leg length becomes excessive when RNAV guidance is used for holding.\n\nWhen holding at a fix and instructions are received specifying the time of departure from the fix, the pilot should adjust the aircraft's flight path within the limits of the established holding pattern in order to leave the fix at the exact time specified. After departing the holding fix, normal speed is to be resumed with respect to other governing speed requirements, such as terminal area speed limits, specific ATC requests, etc. Where the fix is associated with an instrument approach and timed approaches are in effect, a procedure turn must not be executed unless the pilot advises ATC, since aircraft holding are expected to proceed inbound on final approach directly from the holding pattern when approach clearance is received.\n\nRadar surveillance of holding pattern airspace areas.\n\nWhenever aircraft are holding, ATC will usually provide radar surveillance of the holding airspace on the controller's radar display.\n\n\nThe controller will attempt to detect any holding aircraft that stray outside the holding airspace and will assist any detected aircraft to return to the assigned airspace.\n\nNOTE-\nMany factors could prevent ATC from providing this additional service, such as workload, number of targets, precipitation, ground clutter, and radar system capability. These circumstances may make it unfeasible to maintain radar identification of aircraft to detect aircraft straying from the holding pattern. The provision of this service depends entirely upon whether controllers believe they are in a position to provide it and does not relieve a pilot of their responsibility to adhere to an accepted ATC clearance.\n\nATC is responsible for traffic and obstruction separation when they have assigned holding that is not associated with a published (charted) holding pattern. Altitudes assigned will be at or above the minimum vectoring or minimum IFR altitude.\n\nIf an aircraft is established in a published holding pattern at an assigned altitude above the published minimum holding altitude and subsequently cleared for the approach, the pilot may descend to the published minimum holding altitude. The holding pattern would only be a segment of the IAP if it is published on the instrument procedure chart and is used in lieu of a procedure turn.\n\nFor those holding patterns where there are no published minimum holding altitudes, the pilot, upon receiving an approach clearance, must maintain the last assigned altitude until leaving the holding pattern and established on the inbound course. Thereafter, the published minimum altitude of the route segment being flown will apply. It is expected that the pilot will be assigned a holding altitude that will permit a normal descent on the inbound course."

                "section-content": "A pilot who encounters a distress or urgency condition can obtain assistance simply by contacting the air traffic facility or other agency in whose area of responsibility the aircraft is operating, stating the nature of the difficulty, pilot's intentions and assistance desired. Distress and urgency communications procedures are prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), however, and have decided advantages over the informal procedure described above.\n\n\nDistress and urgency communications procedures discussed in the following paragraphs relate to the use of air ground voice communications.\n\nThe initial communication, and if considered necessary, any subsequent transmissions by an aircraft in distress should begin with the signal MAYDAY, preferably repeated three times. The signal PAN-PAN should be used in the same manner for an urgency condition.\n\nDistress communications have absolute priority over all other communications, and the word MAYDAY commands radio silence on the frequency in use. Urgency communications have priority over all other communications except distress, and the word PAN-PAN warns other stations not to interfere with urgency transmissions.\n\nNormally, the station addressed will be the air\u2009traffic facility or other agency providing air traffic services, on the frequency in use at the time. If the pilot is not communicating and receiving services, the station to be called will normally be the air traffic facility or other agency in whose area of responsibility the aircraft is operating, on the appropriate assigned frequency. If the station addressed does not respond, or if time or the situation dictates, the distress or urgency message may be broadcast, or a collect call may be used, addressing \u201cAny Station (Tower)(Radio)(Radar).\u201d\n\nThe station addressed should immediately acknowledge a distress or urgency message, provide assistance, coordinate and direct the activities of assisting facilities, and alert the appropriate search and rescue coordinator if warranted. Responsibility will be transferred to another station only if better handling will result.\n\nAll other stations, aircraft and ground, will continue to listen until it is evident that assistance is being provided. If any station becomes aware that the station being called either has not received a distress or urgency message, or cannot communicate with the aircraft in difficulty, it will attempt to contact the aircraft and provide assistance.\n\nAlthough the frequency in use or other frequencies assigned by ATC are preferable, the following emergency frequencies can be used for distress or urgency communications, if necessary or desirable:\n121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz. Both have a range generally limited to line of sight. 121.5 MHz is guarded by direction finding stations and some military and civil aircraft. 243.0 MHz is guarded by military aircraft. Both 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz are guarded by military towers, most civil towers, and radar facilities. Normally ARTCC emergency frequency capability does not extend to radar coverage limits. If an ARTCC does not respond when called on 121.5 MHz or 243.0 MHz, call the nearest tower."

                "section-content": "A successful aircraft ditching is dependent on three primary factors. In order of importance they are:\n\nSea conditions and wind.\n\n\nType of aircraft.\n\nSkill and technique of pilot.\n\n\nCommon oceanographic terminology.\n\nSea. The condition of the surface that is the result of both waves and swells.\n\n\nWave (or Chop). The condition of the surface caused by the local winds.\n\nSwell. The condition of the surface which has been caused by a distance disturbance.\n\nSwell Face. The side of the swell toward the observer. The backside is the side away from the observer. These definitions apply regardless of the direction of swell movement.\n\nPrimary Swell. The swell system having the greatest height from trough to crest.\n\nSecondary Swells. Those swell systems of less height than the primary swell.\n\nFetch. The distance the waves have been driven by a wind blowing in a constant direction, without obstruction.\n\nSwell Period. The time interval between the passage of two successive crests at the same spot in the water, measured in seconds.\n\nSwell Velocity. The speed and direction of the swell with relation to a fixed reference point, measured in knots. There is little movement of water in the horizontal direction. Swells move primarily in a vertical motion, similar to the motion observed when shaking out a carpet.\n\nSwell Direction. The direction from which a swell is moving. This direction is not necessarily the result of the wind present at the scene. The swell may be moving into or across the local wind. Swells, once set in motion, tend to maintain their original direction for as long as they continue in deep water, regardless of changes in wind direction.\n\nSwell Height. The height between crest and trough, measured in feet. The vast majority of ocean swells are lower than 12 to 15 feet, and swells over 25 feet are not common at any spot on the oceans. Successive swells may differ considerably in height.\n\nIn order to select a good heading when ditching an aircraft, a basic evaluation of the sea is required. Selection of a good ditching heading may well minimize damage and could save your life. It can be extremely dangerous to land into the wind without regard to sea conditions; the swell system, or systems, must be taken into consideration. Remember one axiom- AVOID THE FACE OF A SWELL.\n\nIn ditching parallel to the swell, it makes little difference whether touchdown is on the top of the crest or in the trough. It is preferable, however, to land on the top or back side of the swell, if possible. After determining which heading (and its reciprocal) will parallel the swell, select the heading with the most into the wind component.\n\n\nIf only one swell system exists, the problem is relatively simple-even with a high, fast system. Unfortunately, most cases involve two or more swell systems running in different directions. With more than one system present, the sea presents a confused appearance. One of the most difficult situations occurs when two swell systems are at right angles. For example, if one system is eight feet high, and the other three feet, plan to land parallel to the primary system, and on the down swell of the secondary system. If both systems are of equal height, a compromise may be advisable-select an intermediate heading at 45 degrees down swell to both systems. When landing down a secondary swell, attempt to touch down on the back side, not on the face of the swell.\n\nIf the swell system is formidable, it is considered advisable, in landplanes, to accept more crosswind in order to avoid landing directly into the swell.\n\nThe secondary swell system is often from the same direction as the wind. Here, the landing may be made parallel to the primary system, with the wind and secondary system at an angle. There is a choice to two directions paralleling the primary system. One direction is downwind and down the secondary swell, and the other is into the wind and into the secondary swell, the choice will depend on the velocity of the wind versus the velocity and height of the secondary swell.\n\nThe simplest method of estimating the wind direction and velocity is to examine the windstreaks on the water. These appear as long streaks up and down wind. Some persons may have difficulty determining wind direction after seeing the streaks on the water. Whitecaps fall forward with the wind but are overrun by the waves thus producing the illusion that the foam is sliding backward. Knowing this, and by observing the direction of the streaks, the wind direction is easily determined. Wind velocity can be estimated by noting the appearance of the whitecaps, foam and wind streaks.\n\nThe behavior of the aircraft on making contact with the water will vary within wide limits according to the state of the sea. If landed parallel to a single swell system, the behavior of the aircraft may approximate that to be expected on a smooth sea. If landed into a heavy swell or into a confused sea, the deceleration forces may be extremely great-resulting in breaking up of the aircraft. Within certain limits, the pilot is able to minimize these forces by proper sea evaluation and selection of ditching heading.\n\n\nWhen on final approach the pilot should look ahead and observe the surface of the sea. There may be shadows and whitecaps-signs of large seas. Shadows and whitecaps close together indicate short and rough seas. Touchdown in these areas is to be avoided. Select and touchdown in any area (only about 500 feet is needed) where the shadows and whitecaps are not so numerous.\n\nTouchdown should be at the lowest speed and rate of descent which permit safe handling and optimum nose up attitude on impact. Once first impact has been made, there is often little the pilot can do to control a landplane.\n\nOnce preditching preparations are completed, the pilot should turn to the ditching heading and commence let-down. The aircraft should be flown low over the water, and slowed down until ten knots or so above stall. At this point, additional power should be used to overcome the increased drag caused by the nose up attitude. When a smooth stretch of water appears ahead, cut power, and touchdown at the best recommended speed as fully stalled as possible. By cutting power when approaching a relatively smooth area, the pilot will prevent overshooting and will touchdown with less chance of planing off into a second uncontrolled landing. Most experienced seaplane pilots prefer to make contact with the water in a semi-stalled attitude, cutting power as the tail makes contact. This technique eliminates the chance of misjudging altitude with a resultant heavy drop in a fully stalled condition. Care must be taken not to drop the aircraft from too high altitude or to balloon due to excessive speed. The altitude above water depends on the aircraft. Over glassy smooth water, or at night without sufficient light, it is very easy, for even the most experienced pilots to misjudge altitude by 50 feet or more. Under such conditions, carry enough power to maintain nine to twelve degrees nose up attitude, and 10 to 20 percent over stalling speed until contact is made with the water. The proper use of power on the approach is of great importance. If power is available on one side only, a little power should be used to flatten the approach; however, the engine should not be used to such an extent that the aircraft cannot be turned against the good engines right down to the stall with a margin of rudder movement available. When near the stall, sudden application of excessive unbalanced power may result in loss of directional control. If power is available on one side only, a slightly higher than normal glide approach speed should be used. This will ensure good control and some margin of speed after leveling off without excessive use of power. The use of power in ditching is so important that when it is certain that the coast cannot be reached, the pilot should, if possible, ditch before fuel is exhausted. The use of power in a night or instrument ditching is far more essential than under daylight contact conditions.\n\nIf no power is available, a greater than normal approach speed should be used down to the flare-out. This speed margin will allow the glide to be broken early and more gradually, thereby giving the pilot time and distance to feel for the surface - decreasing the possibility of stalling high or flying into the water. When landing parallel to a swell system, little difference is noted between landing on top of a crest or in the trough. If the wings of aircraft are trimmed to the surface of the sea rather than the horizon, there is little need to worry about a wing hitting a swell crest. The actual slope of a swell is very gradual. If forced to land into a swell, touchdown should be made just after passage of the crest. If contact is made on the face of the swell, the aircraft may be swamped or thrown violently into the air, dropping heavily into the next swell. If control surfaces remain intact, the pilot should attempt to maintain the proper nose above the horizon attitude by rapid and positive use of the controls.\n\n\nAfter Touchdown. In most cases drift, caused by crosswind can be ignored; the forces acting on the aircraft after touchdown are of such magnitude that drift will be only a secondary consideration. If the aircraft is under good control, the \u201ccrab\u201d may be kicked out with rudder just prior to touchdown. This is more important with high wing aircraft, for they are laterally unstable on the water in a crosswind and may roll to the side in ditching.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\nThis information has been extracted from Appendix H of the \u201cNational Search and Rescue Manual.\u201d"

                "section-content": "Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI)\n\nVASI installations may consist of either 2, 4, 6, 12, or 16 light units arranged in bars referred to as near, middle, and far bars. Most VASI installations consist of 2 bars, near and far, and may consist of 2, 4, or 12 light units. Some VASIs consist of three bars, near, middle, and far, which provide an additional visual glide path to accommodate high cockpit aircraft. This installation may consist of either 6 or 16\u2009light units. VASI installations consisting of 2, 4, or 6 light units are located on one side of the runway, usually the left. Where the installation consists of 12\u2009or 16 light units, the units are located on both sides of the runway.\n\n\nTwo-bar VASI installations provide one visual glide path which is normally set at 3 degrees. Three-bar VASI installations provide two visual glide paths. The lower glide path is provided by the near and middle bars and is normally set at 3 degrees while the upper glide path, provided by the middle and far bars, is normally 1/4 degree higher. This higher glide path is intended for use only by high cockpit aircraft to provide a sufficient threshold crossing height. Although normal glide path angles are three degrees, angles at some locations may be as high as 4.5 degrees to give proper obstacle clearance. Pilots of high performance aircraft are cautioned that use of VASI angles in excess of 3.5 degrees may cause an increase in runway length required for landing and rollout.\n\nThe basic principle of the VASI is that of color differentiation between red and white. Each light unit projects a beam of light having a white segment in the upper part of the beam and red segment in the lower part of the beam. The light units are arranged so that the pilot using the VASIs during an approach will see the combination of lights shown below.\n\nThe VASI is a system of lights so arranged to provide visual descent guidance information during the approach to a runway. These lights are visible from 3-5 miles during the day and up to 20 miles or more at night. The visual glide path of the VASI provides safe obstruction clearance within plus or minus 10 degrees of the extended runway centerline and to 4 NM from the runway threshold. Descent, using the VASI, should not be initiated until the aircraft is visually aligned with the runway. Lateral course guidance is provided by the runway or runway lights. In certain circumstances, the safe obstruction clearance area may be reduced by narrowing the beam width or shortening the usable distance due to local limitations, or the VASI may be offset from the extended runway centerline. This will be noted in the Chart Supplement and/or applicable Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs).\nFIG 2-1-1Precision & Nonprecision Configurations\n\nNOTE-\nCivil ALSF-2 may be operated as SSALR during favorable weather conditions.\n\nFor 2-bar VASI (4 light units) see FIG 2-1-2.\nFIG 2-1-22-Bar VASI\n\nFor 3-bar VASI (6 light units) see FIG 2-1-3.\nFIG 2-1-33-Bar VASI\n\nFor other VASI configurations see FIG 2-1-4.\nFIG 2-1-4VASI Variations\n\n\nPrecision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI). The precision approach path indicator (PAPI) uses light units similar to the VASI but are installed in a single row of either two or four light units. These lights are visible from about 5 miles during the day and up to 20 miles at night. The visual glide path of the PAPI typically provides safe obstruction clearance within plus or minus 10 degrees of the extended runway centerline and to 3.4 NM from the runway threshold. Descent, using the PAPI, should not be initiated until the aircraft is visually aligned with the runway. The row of light units is normally installed on the left side of the runway and the glide path indications are as depicted. Lateral course guidance is provided by the runway or runway lights. In certain circumstances, the safe obstruction clearance area may be reduced by narrowing the beam width or shortening the usable distance due to local limitations, or the PAPI may be offset from the extended runway centerline. This will be noted in the Chart Supplement and/or applicable NOTAMs. (See FIG 2-1-5.)\nFIG 2-1-5Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI)\n\nTri-color Systems. Tri-color visual approach slope indicators normally consist of a single light unit projecting a three-color visual approach path into the final approach area of the runway upon which the indicator is installed. The below glide path indication is red, the above glide path indication is amber, and the on glide path indication is green. These types of indicators have a useful range of approximately one-half to one mile during the day and up to five\u2009miles at night depending upon the visibility conditions. (See FIG 2-1-6.)\nFIG 2-1-6Tri-Color Visual Approach Slope Indicator\n\nNOTE-\nSince the tri-color VASI consists of a single light source which could possibly be confused with other light sources, pilots should exercise care to properly locate and identify the light signal.When the aircraft descends from green to red, the pilot may see a dark amber color during the transition from green to red.\nFIG 2-1-7Pulsating Visual Approach Slope Indicator\n\nNOTE-\nSince the PVASI consists of a single light source which could possibly be confused with other light sources, pilots should exercise care to properly locate and identify the light signal.\nFIG 2-1-8Alignment of Elements\n\nPulsating Systems. Pulsating visual approach\u2009slope indicators normally consist of a single light unit projecting a two-color visual approach path\u2009into the final approach area of the runway upon which the indicator is installed. The on glide path indication may be a steady white light or alternating RED and WHITE light. The slightly below glide path indication is a steady red light. If the aircraft descends further below the glide path, the red light starts to pulsate. The above glide path indication is a pulsating white light. The pulsating rate increases as the aircraft gets further above or below the desired glide slope. The useful range of the system is about four miles during the day and up to ten miles at night. (See FIG 2-1-7.)\n\nAlignment of Elements Systems. Alignment of elements systems are installed on some small general aviation airports and are a low-cost system consisting of painted plywood panels, normally black and white or fluorescent orange. Some of these systems are lighted for night use. The useful range of these systems is approximately three-quarter miles. To use the system the pilot positions the aircraft so the elements are in alignment. The glide path indications are shown in FIG 2-1-8."

                "section-title": "Runway Status Light (RWSL) System",
                "section-content": "Introduction. RWSL is a fully automated system that provides runway status information to pilots and surface vehicle operators to clearly indicate when it is unsafe to enter, cross, takeoff from, or land on a runway. The RWSL system processes information from surveillance systems and activates Runway Entrance Lights (REL) and Takeoff Hold Lights (THL), in accordance with the position and velocity of the detected surface traffic and approach traffic. REL and THL are in-pavement light fixtures that are directly visible to pilots and surface vehicle operators. RWSL is an independent safety enhancement that does not substitute for or convey an ATC clearance. Clearance to enter, cross, takeoff from, land on, or operate on a runway must still be received from ATC. Although ATC has limited control over the system, personnel do not directly use and may not be able to view light fixture activations and deactivations during the conduct of daily ATC operations.\n\n\nRunway Entrance Lights (REL): The REL system is composed of flush mounted, in-pavement, unidirectional light fixtures that are parallel to and focused along the taxiway centerline and directed toward the pilot at the hold line. An array of REL lights include the first light at the hold line followed by a series of evenly spaced lights to the runway edge; one additional light at the runway centerline is in line with the last two lights before the runway edge (see FIG 2-1-9 and FIG 2-1-10). When activated, the red lights indicate that there is high speed traffic on the runway or there is an aircraft on final approach within the activation area.\n\nREL Operating Characteristics - Departing Aircraft: When a departing aircraft reaches a site adaptable speed of approximately 30 knots, all taxiway intersections with REL arrays along the runway ahead of the aircraft will illuminate (see FIG 2-1-9). As the aircraft approaches an REL equipped taxiway intersection, the lights at that intersection extinguish approximately 3 to 4 seconds before the aircraft reaches it. This allows controllers to apply \u201canticipated separation\" to permit ATC to move traffic more expeditiously without compromising safety. After the aircraft is declared \u201cairborne\" by the system, all REL lights associated with this runway will extinguish.\n\n\nREL Operating Characteristics - Arriving Aircraft: When an aircraft on final approach is approximately 1 mile from the runway threshold, all sets of taxiway REL light arrays that intersect the runway illuminate. The distance is adjustable and can be configured for specific operations at particular airports. Lights extinguish at each equipped taxiway intersection approximately 3 to 4 seconds before the aircraft reaches it to apply anticipated separation until the aircraft has slowed to approximately 80 knots (site adjustable parameter). Below 80 knots, all arrays that are not within 30 seconds of the aircraft's forward path are extinguished. Once the arriving aircraft slows to approximately 34 knots (site adjustable parameter), it is declared to be in a taxi state, and all lights extinguish.\n\nWhat a pilot would observe: A pilot at or approaching the hold line to a runway will observe RELs illuminate and extinguish in reaction to an aircraft or vehicle operating on the runway, or an arriving aircraft operating less than 1 mile from the runway threshold.\n\nWhen a pilot observes the red lights of the REL, that pilot will stop at the hold line or remain stopped. The pilot will then contact ATC for resolution if the clearance is in conflict with the lights. Should pilots note illuminated lights under circumstances when remaining clear of the runway is impractical for safety reasons (for example, aircraft is already on the runway), the crew should proceed according to their best judgment while understanding the illuminated lights indicate the runway is unsafe to enter or cross. Contact ATC at the earliest possible opportunity.\nFIG 2-1-9Runway Status Light System\n\nTakeoff Hold Lights (THL) : The THL system is composed of flush mounted, in-pavement, unidirectional light fixtures in a double longitudinal row aligned either side of the runway centerline lighting. Fixtures are focused toward the arrival end of the runway at the \u201cline up and wait\" point. THLs extend for 1,500 feet in front of the holding aircraft starting at a point 375 feet from the departure threshold (see FIG 2-1-11). Illuminated red lights provide a signal, to an aircraft in position for takeoff or rolling, that it is unsafe to takeoff because the runway is occupied or about to be occupied by another aircraft or ground vehicle. Two aircraft, or a surface vehicle and an aircraft, are required for the lights to illuminate. The departing aircraft must be in position for takeoff or beginning takeoff roll. Another aircraft or a surface vehicle must be on or about to cross the runway.\n\nTHL Operating Characteristics - Departing Aircraft: THLs will illuminate for an aircraft in position for departure or departing when there is another aircraft or vehicle on the runway or about to enter the runway (see FIG 2-1-9.) Once that aircraft or vehicle exits the runway, the THLs extinguish. A pilot may notice lights extinguish prior to the downfield aircraft or vehicle being completely clear of the runway but still moving. Like RELs, THLs have an \u201canticipated separation\" feature.\n\nNOTE-\nWhen the THLs extinguish, this is not clearance to begin a takeoff roll. All takeoff clearances will be issued by ATC.\n\n\nWhat a pilot would observe: A pilot in position to depart from a runway, or has begun takeoff roll, will observe THLs illuminate in reaction to an aircraft or vehicle on the runway or entering or crossing it. Lights will extinguish when the runway is clear. A pilot may observe several cycles of illumination and extinguishing depending on the amount of crossing traffic.\n\nWhen a pilot observes the red light of the THLs, the pilot should safely stop if it's feasible or remain stopped. The pilot must contact ATC for resolution if any clearance is in conflict with the lights. Should pilots note illuminated lights while in takeoff roll and under circumstances when stopping is impractical for safety reasons, the crew should proceed according to their best judgment while understanding the illuminated lights indicate that continuing the takeoff is unsafe. Contact ATC at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nPilot Actions:\n\nWhen operating at airports with RWSL, pilots will operate with the transponder/ADS-B \u201cOn\" when departing the gate or parking area until it is shut down upon arrival at the gate or parking area. This ensures interaction with the FAA surveillance systems such as ASDE-X/Airport Surface Surveillance Capability (ASSC) which provide information to the RWSL system.\n\n\nPilots must always inform the ATCT when they have stopped due to an RWSL indication that is in conflict with ATC instructions. Pilots must request clarification of the taxi or takeoff clearance.\n\nNever cross over illuminated red lights. Under normal circumstances, RWSL will confirm the pilot's taxi or takeoff clearance previously issued by ATC. If RWSL indicates that it is unsafe to takeoff from, land on, cross, or enter a runway, immediately notify ATC of the conflict and re-confirm the clearance.\n\nDo not proceed when lights have extinguished without an ATC clearance. RWSL verifies an ATC clearance; it does not substitute for an ATC clearance.\n\nATC Control of RWSL System:\n\nControllers can set in-pavement lights to one of five (5) brightness levels to assure maximum conspicuity under all visibility and lighting conditions. REL and THL subsystems may be independently set.\n\n\nSystem lights can be disabled should RWSL operations impact the efficient movement of air traffic or contribute, in the opinion of the assigned ATC Manager, to unsafe operations. REL and THL light fixtures may be disabled separately. Whenever the system or a component is disabled, a NOTAM must be issued, and the Automatic Terminal Information System (ATIS) must be updated."

                "section-content": "With FAA approved systems, various combinations of medium intensity approach lights, runway lights, taxiway lights, VASI and/or REIL may be activated by radio control. On runways with both approach lighting and runway lighting (runway edge lights, taxiway lights, etc.) systems, the approach lighting system takes precedence for air-to-ground radio control over the runway lighting system which is set at a predetermined intensity step, based on expected visibility conditions. Runways without approach lighting may provide radio controlled intensity adjustments of runway edge lights. Other lighting systems, including VASI, REIL, and taxiway lights may be either controlled with the runway edge lights or controlled independently of the runway edge lights.\n\n\nThe control system consists of a 3-step control responsive to 7, 5, and/or 3 microphone clicks. This 3-step control will turn on lighting facilities capable of either 3-step, 2-step or 1-step operation. The 3-step and 2-step lighting facilities can be altered in intensity, while the 1-step cannot. All lighting is illuminated for a period of 15 minutes from the most recent time of activation and may not be extinguished prior to end of the 15 minute period (except for 1-step and 2-step REILs which may be turned off when desired by keying the mike 5 or 3 times respectively).\n\nSuggested use is to always initially key the mike 7 times; this assures that all controlled lights are turned on to the maximum available intensity. If desired, adjustment can then be made, where the capability is provided, to a lower intensity (or the REIL turned off) by keying 5 and/or 3 times. Due to the close proximity of airports using the same frequency, radio controlled lighting receivers may be set at a low sensitivity requiring the aircraft to be relatively close to activate the system. Consequently, even when lights are on, always key mike as directed when overflying an airport of intended landing or just prior to entering the final segment of an approach. This will assure the aircraft is close enough to activate the system and a full 15 minutes lighting duration is available. Approved lighting systems may be activated by keying the mike (within 5 seconds) as indicated in TBL 2-1-3.\nTBL 2-1-3Radio Control System\n\n\n\nKey Mike\n\n\nFunction\n\n\n\n\n7 times within 5 seconds\n\n\nHighest intensity available\n\n\n\n\n5 times within 5 seconds\n\n\nMedium or lower intensity (Lower REIL or REIL-off)\n\n\n\n\n3 times within 5 seconds\n\n\nLowest intensity available (Lower REIL or REIL-off)\n\n\n\nFor all public use airports with FAA standard systems the Chart Supplement contains the types of lighting, runway and the frequency that is used to activate the system. Airports with IAPs include data on the approach chart identifying the light system, the runway on which they are installed, and the frequency that is used to activate the system.\n\nNOTE-\nAlthough the CTAF is used to activate the lights at many airports, other frequencies may also be used. The appropriate frequency for activating the lights on the airport is provided in the Chart Supplement and the standard instrument approach procedures publications. It is not identified on the sectional charts.\n\nWhere the airport is not served by an IAP, it may have either the standard FAA approved control system or an independent type system of different specification installed by the airport sponsor. The Chart Supplement contains descriptions of pilot controlled lighting systems for each airport having other than FAA approved systems, and explains the type lights, method of control, and operating frequency in clear text."

Taxiway centerline lights are used to facilitate ground traffic under low visibility conditions. They are located along the taxiway centerline in a straight line on straight portions, on the centerline of curved portions, and along designated taxiing paths in portions of runways, ramp, and apron areas. Taxiway centerline lights are steady burning and emit green light.\n\nClearance Bar Lights. Clearance bar lights are installed at holding positions on taxiways in order to increase the conspicuity of the holding position in low visibility conditions. They may also be installed to indicate the location of an intersecting taxiway during periods of darkness. Clearance bars consist of three in-pavement steady-burning yellow lights.\n\nRunway Guard Lights. Runway guard lights are installed at taxiway/runway intersections. They are primarily used to enhance the conspicuity of taxiway/runway intersections during low visibility conditions, but may be used in all weather conditions.

They should not be confused with clearance bar lights described in paragraph 2-1-10c, Clearance Bar Lights.\n\nStop Bar Lights. Stop bar lights, when installed, are used to confirm the ATC clearance to enter or cross the active runway in low visibility conditions (below 1,200 ft Runway Visual Range). A stop bar consists of a row of red, unidirectional, steady-burning in-pavement lights installed across the entire taxiway at the runway holding position, and elevated steady-burning red lights on each side. A controlled stop bar is operated in conjunction with the taxiway centerline lead-on lights which extend from the stop bar toward the runway. Following the ATC clearance to proceed, the stop bar is turned off and the lead-on lights are turned on. The stop bar and lead-on lights are automatically reset by a sensor or backup timer.\n\nCAUTION-\n \nPilots should never cross a red illuminated stop bar, even if an ATC clearance has been given to proceed onto or across the runway.\n\nNOTE-\nIf after crossing a stop bar, the taxiway centerline lead-on lights inadvertently extinguish, pilots should hold their position and contact ATC for further instructions."

The periodic medical examinations required for medical certification are conducted by designated Aviation Medical Examiners, who are physicians with a special interest in aviation safety and training in aviation medicine.\n\n\nThe standards for medical certification are contained in 14 CFR Part 67. Pilots who have a history of certain medical conditions described in these standards are mandatorily disqualified from flying. These medical conditions include a personality disorder manifested by overt acts, a psychosis, alcoholism, drug dependence, epilepsy, an\u2009unexplained disturbance of consciousness, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and diabetes requiring medication for its control. Other medical conditions may be temporarily disqualifying, such as acute infections, anemia, and peptic ulcer. Pilots who do not meet medical standards may still be qualified under special issuance provisions or the exemption process. This may require that either additional medical information be provided or practical flight tests be conducted.\n\nStudent pilots should visit an Aviation Medical Examiner as soon as possible in their flight training in order to avoid unnecessary training expenses should they not meet the medical standards. For the same reason, the student pilot who plans to enter commercial aviation should apply for the highest class of medical certificate that might be necessary in the pilot's career.\n\nCAUTION-\n \nThe CFRs prohibit a pilot who possesses a current medical certificate from performing crewmember duties while the pilot has a known medical condition or increase of a known medical condition that would make the pilot unable to meet the standards for the medical certificate.\n\n\nIllness.\n\nEven a minor illness suffered in day\u2010to\u2010day living can seriously degrade performance of many piloting tasks vital to safe flight. Illness can produce fever and distracting symptoms that can impair judgment, memory, alertness, and the ability to make calculations. Although symptoms from an illness may be under adequate control with a medication, the medication itself may decrease pilot performance.\n\n\nThe safest rule is not to fly while suffering from any illness. If this rule is considered too stringent for a particular illness, the pilot should contact an Aviation Medical Examiner for advice.\n\nMedication.\n\nPilot performance can be seriously degraded by both prescribed and over\u2010the\u2010counter medications, as well as by the medical conditions for which they are taken. Many medications, such as tranquilizers, sedatives, strong pain relievers, and cough\u2010suppressant preparations, have primary effects that may impair judgment, memory, alertness, coordination, vision, and the ability to make calculations. Others, such as antihistamines, blood pressure drugs, muscle relaxants, and agents to control diarrhea and motion sickness, have side effects that may impair the same critical functions. Any medication that depresses the nervous system, such as a sedative, tranquilizer or antihistamine, can make a pilot much more susceptible to hypoxia.\n\n\nThe CFRs prohibit pilots from performing crewmember duties while using any medication that affects the faculties in any way contrary to safety. The safest rule is not to fly as a crewmember while taking any medication, unless approved to do so by the FAA.\n\nAlcohol.\n\nExtensive research has provided a number of facts about the hazards of alcohol consumption and flying. As little as one ounce of liquor, one bottle of beer or four ounces of wine can impair flying skills, with the alcohol consumed in these drinks being detectable in the breath and blood for at least 3 hours. Even after the body completely destroys a moderate amount of alcohol, a pilot can still be severely impaired for many hours by hangover. There is simply no way of increasing the destruction of alcohol or alleviating a hangover. Alcohol also renders a pilot much more susceptible to disorientation and hypoxia.\n\n\nA consistently high alcohol related fatal aircraft accident rate serves to emphasize that alcohol and flying are a potentially lethal combination. The CFRs prohibit pilots from performing crewmember duties within 8 hours after drinking any alcoholic beverage or while under the influence of alcohol. However, due to the slow destruction of alcohol, a pilot may still be under influence 8 hours after drinking a moderate amount of alcohol. Therefore, an excellent rule is to allow at least 12 to 24 hours between \u201cbottle and throttle,\u201d depending on the amount of alcoholic beverage consumed.\n\nFatigue.\n\nFatigue continues to be one of the most treacherous hazards to flight safety, as it may not be apparent to a pilot until serious errors are made. Fatigue is best described as either acute (short\u2010term) or chronic (long\u2010term).\n\n\nA normal occurrence of everyday living, acute fatigue is the tiredness felt after long periods of physical and mental strain, including strenuous muscular effort, immobility, heavy mental workload, strong emotional pressure, monotony, and lack of sleep. Consequently, coordination and alertness, so vital to safe pilot performance, can be reduced. Acute fatigue is prevented by adequate rest and sleep, as well as by regular exercise and proper nutrition.\n\nChronic fatigue occurs when there is not enough time for full recovery between episodes of acute fatigue. Performance continues to fall off, and judgment becomes impaired so that unwarranted risks may be taken. Recovery from chronic fatigue requires a prolonged period of rest.\n\nOBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA). OSA is now recognized as an important preventable factor identified in transportation accidents. OSA interrupts the normal restorative sleep necessary for normal functioning and is associated with chronic illnesses such as hypertension, heart attack, stroke, obesity, and diabetes. Symptoms include snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, intermittent prolonged breathing pauses while sleeping, memory impairment and lack of concentration. There are many available treatments which can reverse the day time symptoms and reduce the chance of an accident. OSA can be easily treated. Most treatments are acceptable for medical certification upon demonstrating effective treatment. If you have any symptoms described above, or neck size over 17 inches in men or 16 inches in women, or a body mass index greater than 30 you should be evaluated for sleep apnea by a sleep medicine specialist.\n(https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html) With treatment you can avoid or delay the onset of these chronic illnesses and prolong a quality life.\n\nStress.\n\nStress from the pressures of everyday living can impair pilot performance, often in very subtle ways. Difficulties, particularly at work, can occupy thought processes enough to markedly decrease alertness. Distraction can so interfere with judgment that unwarranted risks are taken, such as flying into deteriorating weather conditions to keep on schedule. Stress and fatigue (see above) can be an extremely hazardous combination.\n\n\nMost pilots do not leave stress \u201con the ground.\u201d Therefore, when more than usual difficulties are being experienced, a pilot should consider delaying flight until these difficulties are satisfactorily resolved.\n\nEmotion.\nCertain emotionally upsetting events, including a serious argument, death of a family member, separation or divorce, loss of job, and financial catastrophe, can render a pilot unable to fly an aircraft safely. The emotions of anger, depression, and anxiety from such events not only decrease alertness but also may lead to taking risks that border on self\u2010destruction. Any pilot who experiences an emotionally upsetting event should not fly until satisfactorily recovered from it.\nPersonal Checklist. Aircraft accident statistics show that pilots should be conducting preflight checklists on themselves as well as their aircraft for pilot impairment contributes to many more accidents than failures of aircraft systems. A personal checklist, which includes all of the categories of pilot impairment as discussed in this section, that can be easily committed to memory is being distributed by the FAA in the form of a wallet\u2010sized card.\n\nPERSONAL CHECKLIST. I'm physically and mentally safe to fly; not being impaired by:\n\n\n\nIllness\n\n\n\n\nMedication\n\n\n\n\nStress\n\n\n\n\nAlcohol\n\n\n\n\nFatigue\n\n\n\n\nEmotion"

                "section-content": "Hypoxia.\n\nHypoxia is a state of oxygen deficiency in the body sufficient to impair functions of the brain and other organs. Hypoxia from exposure to altitude is due only to the reduced barometric pressures encountered at altitude, for the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere remains about 21 percent from the ground out to space.\n\n\nAlthough a deterioration in night vision occurs at a cabin pressure altitude as low as 5,000\u2009feet, other significant effects of altitude hypoxia usually do not occur in the normal healthy pilot below 12,000 feet. From 12,000 to 15,000 feet of altitude, judgment, memory, alertness, coordination and ability to make calculations are impaired, and headache, drowsiness, dizziness and either a sense of well\u2010being (euphoria) or belligerence occur. The effects appear following increasingly shorter periods of exposure to increasing altitude. In fact, pilot performance can seriously deteriorate within 15\u2009minutes at 15,000 feet.\n\nAt cabin pressure altitudes above 15,000 feet, the periphery of the visual field grays out to a point where only central vision remains (tunnel vision). A blue coloration (cyanosis) of the fingernails and lips develops. The ability to take corrective and protective action is lost in 20 to 30 minutes at 18,000 feet and 5\u2009to 12 minutes at 20,000 feet, followed soon thereafter by unconsciousness.\n\nThe altitude at which significant effects of hypoxia occur can be lowered by a number of factors. Carbon monoxide inhaled in smoking or from exhaust fumes, lowered hemoglobin (anemia), and certain medications can reduce the oxygen\u2010carrying capacity of the blood to the degree that the amount of oxygen provided to body tissues will already be equivalent to the oxygen provided to the tissues when exposed to a cabin pressure altitude of several thousand feet. Small amounts of alcohol and low doses of certain drugs, such as antihistamines, tranquilizers, sedatives and analgesics can, through their depressant action, render the brain much more susceptible to hypoxia. Extreme heat and cold, fever, and anxiety increase the body's demand for oxygen, and hence its susceptibility to hypoxia.\n\nThe effects of hypoxia are usually quite difficult to recognize, especially when they occur gradually. Since symptoms of hypoxia do not vary in an individual, the ability to recognize hypoxia can be greatly improved by experiencing and witnessing the effects of hypoxia during an altitude chamber \u201cflight.\u201d The FAA provides this opportunity through aviation physiology training, which is conducted at the FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute and at many military facilities across the U.S. To attend the Physiological Training Program at the Civil Aeromedical Institute, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, OK, contact by telephone (405) 954-6212, or by writing Aerospace Medical Education Division, AAM-400, CAMI, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma\u2009City, OK 73125.\n\nNOTE-\nTo attend the physiological training program at one of the military installations having the training capability, an application form and a fee must be submitted. Full particulars about location, fees, scheduling procedures, course content, individual requirements, etc., are contained in the Physiological Training Application, Form Number AC 3150-7, which is obtained by contacting the accident prevention specialist or the office forms manager in the nearest FAA office.\n\nHypoxia is prevented by heeding factors that reduce tolerance to altitude, by enriching the inspired air with oxygen from an appropriate oxygen system, and by maintaining a comfortable, safe cabin pressure altitude. For optimum protection, pilots are encouraged to use supplemental oxygen above 10,000 feet during the day, and above 5,000 feet at night. The CFRs require that at the minimum, flight crew be provided with and use supplemental oxygen after 30 minutes of exposure to cabin pressure altitudes between 12,500 and 14,000 feet and immediately on exposure to cabin pressure altitudes above 14,000 feet. Every occupant of the aircraft must be provided with supplemental oxygen at cabin pressure altitudes above 15,000 feet.\n\n\nEar Block.\n\nAs the aircraft cabin pressure decreases during ascent, the expanding air in the middle ear pushes the eustachian tube open, and by escaping down it to the nasal passages, equalizes in pressure with the cabin pressure. But during descent, the pilot must periodically open the eustachian tube to equalize pressure. This can be accomplished by swallowing, yawning, tensing muscles in the throat, or if these do not work, by a combination of closing the mouth, pinching the nose closed, and attempting to blow through the nostrils (Valsalva maneuver).\n\n\nEither an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold or sore throat, or a nasal allergic condition can produce enough congestion around the eustachian tube to make equalization difficult. Consequently, the difference in pressure between the middle ear and aircraft cabin can build up to a level that will hold the eustachian tube closed, making equalization difficult if not impossible. The problem is commonly referred to as an \u201cear block.\u201d\n\nAn ear block produces severe ear pain and loss of hearing that can last from several hours to several days. Rupture of the ear drum can occur in flight or after landing. Fluid can accumulate in the middle ear and become infected.\n\nAn ear block is prevented by not flying with an upper respiratory infection or nasal allergic condition. Adequate protection is usually not provided by decongestant sprays or drops to reduce congestion around the eustachian tubes. Oral decongestants have side effects that can significantly impair pilot performance.\n\nIf an ear block does not clear shortly after landing, a physician should be consulted.\n\nSinus Block.\n\nDuring ascent and descent, air pressure in the sinuses equalizes with the aircraft cabin pressure through small openings that connect the sinuses to the nasal passages. Either an upper respiratory infection, such as a cold or sinusitis, or a nasal allergic condition can produce enough congestion around an opening to slow equalization, and as the difference in pressure between the sinus and cabin mounts, eventually plug the opening. This \u201csinus block\u201d occurs most frequently during descent.\n\n\nA sinus block can occur in the frontal sinuses, located above each eyebrow, or in the maxillary sinuses, located in each upper cheek. It will usually produce excruciating pain over the sinus area. A maxillary sinus block can also make the upper teeth ache. Bloody mucus may discharge from the nasal passages.\n\nA sinus block is prevented by not flying with an upper respiratory infection or nasal allergic condition. Adequate protection is usually not provided by decongestant sprays or drops to reduce congestion around the sinus openings. Oral decongestants have side effects that can impair pilot performance.\n\nIf a sinus block does not clear shortly after landing, a physician should be consulted.\n\nDecompression Sickness After Scuba Diving.\n\nA pilot or passenger who intends to fly after scuba diving should allow the body sufficient time to rid itself of excess nitrogen absorbed during diving. If not, altitude decompression sickness due to evolved nitrogen gas can occur during exposure to reduced barometric pressure (i.e., low cabin pressure) associated with increased altitude and may lead to a serious inflight emergency.\n\n\nThe recommended wait time before going to flight altitudes up to 8,000 feet is at least 12 hours after diving that did not require a controlled ascent (i.e., non-decompression stop diving), and at least 24 hours after diving that required a controlled ascent (i.e., decompression stop diving). The recommended wait time before going to flight altitudes above 8,000 feet is at least 24 hours after any SCUBA dive. These recommended altitudes are actual flight altitudes above mean sea level (AMSL) and not pressurized cabin altitudes. This takes into consideration the risk of aircraft decompression during flight."

As hyperventilation \u201cblows off\u201d excessive carbon dioxide from the body, a pilot can experience symptoms of lightheadedness, suffocation, drowsiness, tingling in the extremities, and coolness and react to them with even greater hyperventilation. Incapacitation can eventually result from incoordination, disorientation, and painful muscle spasms. Finally, unconsciousness can occur.\n\n\nThe symptoms of hyperventilation subside within a few minutes after the rate and depth of breathing are consciously brought back under control. The buildup of carbon dioxide in the body can be hastened by controlled breathing in and out of a paper bag held over the nose and mouth.\n\nEarly symptoms of hyperventilation and hypoxia are similar. Moreover, hyperventilation and hypoxia can occur at the same time. Therefore, if a pilot is using an oxygen system when symptoms are experienced, the oxygen regulator should immediately be set to deliver 100 percent oxygen, and then the system checked to assure that it has been functioning effectively before giving attention to rate and depth of breathing."

                "section-content": "Introduction. Many different illusions can be experienced in flight. Some can lead to spatial disorientation. Others can lead to landing errors. Illusions rank among the most common factors cited as contributing to fatal aircraft accidents.\n\n\nIllusions Leading to Spatial Disorientation.\n\nVarious complex motions and forces and certain visual scenes encountered in flight can create illusions of motion and position. Spatial disorientation from these illusions can be prevented only by visual reference to reliable, fixed points on the ground or to flight instruments.\n\n\nThe leans. An abrupt correction of a banked attitude, which has been entered too slowly to stimulate the motion sensing system in the inner ear, can create the illusion of banking in the opposite direction. The disoriented pilot will roll the aircraft back into its original dangerous attitude, or if level flight is maintained, will feel compelled to lean in the perceived vertical plane until this illusion subsides.\n\nCoriolis illusion. An abrupt head movement in a prolonged constant\u2010rate turn that has ceased stimulating the motion sensing system can create the illusion of rotation or movement in an entirely different axis. The disoriented pilot will maneuver the aircraft into a dangerous attitude in an attempt to stop rotation. This most overwhelming of all illusions in flight may be prevented by not making sudden, extreme head movements, particularly while making prolonged constant\u2010rate turns under IFR conditions.\n\n\nGraveyard spin. A proper recovery from a spin that has ceased stimulating the motion sensing system can create the illusion of spinning in the opposite direction. The disoriented pilot will return the aircraft to its original spin.\n\nGraveyard spiral. An observed loss of altitude during a coordinated constant\u2010rate turn that has ceased stimulating the motion sensing system can create the illusion of being in a descent with the wings level. The disoriented pilot will pull back on the controls, tightening the spiral and increasing the loss of altitude.\n\nSomatogravic illusion. A rapid acceleration during takeoff can create the illusion of being in a nose up attitude. The disoriented pilot will push the aircraft into a nose low, or dive attitude. A rapid deceleration by a quick reduction of the throttles can have the opposite effect, with the disoriented pilot pulling the aircraft into a nose up, or stall attitude.\n\nInversion illusion. An abrupt change from climb to straight and level flight can create the illusion of tumbling backwards. The disoriented pilot will push the aircraft abruptly into a nose low attitude, possibly intensifying this illusion.\n\nElevator illusion. An abrupt upward vertical acceleration, usually by an updraft, can create the illusion of being in a climb. The disoriented pilot will push the aircraft into a nose low attitude. An abrupt downward vertical acceleration, usually by a downdraft, has the opposite effect, with the disoriented pilot pulling the aircraft into a nose up attitude.\n\nFalse horizon. Sloping cloud formations, an obscured horizon, a dark scene spread with ground lights and stars, and certain geometric patterns of ground light can create illusions of not being aligned correctly with the actual horizon. The disoriented pilot will place the aircraft in a dangerous attitude.\n\nAutokinesis. In the dark, a static light will appear to move about when stared at for many seconds. The disoriented pilot will lose control of the aircraft in attempting to align it with the light.\n\nIllusions Leading to Landing Errors.\n\nVarious surface features and atmospheric conditions encountered in landing can create illusions of incorrect height above and distance from the runway threshold. Landing errors from these illusions can be prevented by anticipating them during approaches, aerial visual inspection of unfamiliar airports before landing, using electronic glide slope or VASI systems when available, and maintaining optimum proficiency in landing procedures.\n\n\nRunway width illusion. A narrower\u2010than\u2010usual runway can create the illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is. The pilot who does not recognize this illusion will fly a lower approach, with the risk of striking objects along the approach path or landing short. A wider\u2010than\u2010usual runway can have the opposite effect, with the risk of leveling out high and landing hard or overshooting the runway.\n\nRunway and terrain slopes illusion. An upsloping runway, upsloping terrain, or both, can create the illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is. The pilot who does not recognize this illusion will fly a lower approach. A downsloping runway, downsloping approach terrain, or both, can have the opposite effect.\n\nFeatureless terrain illusion. An absence of ground features, as when landing over water, darkened areas, and terrain made featureless by snow, can create the illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is. The pilot who does not recognize this illusion will fly a lower approach.\n\nAtmospheric illusions. Rain on the windscreen can create the illusion of greater height, and atmospheric haze the illusion of being at a greater distance from the runway. The pilot who does not recognize these illusions will fly a lower approach. Penetration of fog can create the illusion of pitching up. The pilot who does not recognize this illusion will steepen the approach, often quite abruptly.\n\nGround lighting illusions. Lights along a straight path, such as a road, and even lights on moving trains can be mistaken for runway and approach lights. Bright runway and approach lighting systems, especially where few lights illuminate the surrounding terrain, may create the illusion of less distance to the runway. The pilot who does not recognize this illusion will fly a higher approach. Conversely, the pilot overflying terrain which has few lights to provide height cues may make a lower than normal approach."

                "section-content": "Introduction. Of the body senses, vision is the most important for safe flight. Major factors that determine how effectively vision can be used are the level of illumination and the technique of scanning the sky for other aircraft.\n\n\nVision Under Dim and Bright Illumination.\n\nUnder conditions of dim illumination, small print and colors on aeronautical charts and aircraft instruments become unreadable unless adequate cockpit lighting is available. Moreover, another aircraft must be much closer to be seen unless its navigation lights are on.\n\n\nIn darkness, vision becomes more sensitive to light, a process called dark adaptation. Although exposure to total darkness for at least 30 minutes is required for complete dark adaptation, a pilot can achieve a moderate degree of dark adaptation within 20 minutes under dim red cockpit lighting. Since red light severely distorts colors, especially on aeronautical charts, and can cause serious difficulty in focusing the eyes on objects inside the aircraft, its use is advisable only where optimum outside night vision capability is necessary. Even so, white cockpit lighting must be available when needed for map and instrument reading, especially under IFR conditions. Dark adaptation is impaired by exposure to cabin pressure altitudes above 5,000 feet, carbon monoxide inhaled in smoking and from exhaust fumes, deficiency of Vitamin A in the diet, and by prolonged exposure to bright sunlight. Since any degree of dark adaptation is lost within a few seconds of viewing a bright light, a pilot should close one eye when using a light to preserve some degree of night vision.\n\nExcessive illumination, especially from light reflected off the canopy, surfaces inside the aircraft, clouds, water, snow, and desert terrain, can produce glare, with uncomfortable squinting, watering of the eyes, and even temporary blindness. Sunglasses for protection from glare should absorb at least 85\u2009percent of visible light (15 percent transmittance) and all colors equally (neutral transmittance), with negligible image distortion from refractive and prismatic errors.\n\nScanning for Other Aircraft.\n\nScanning the sky for other aircraft is a key factor in collision avoidance. It should be used continuously by the pilot and copilot (or right seat passenger) to cover all areas of the sky visible from the cockpit. Although pilots must meet specific visual acuity requirements, the ability to read an eye chart does not ensure that one will be able to efficiently spot other aircraft. Pilots must develop an effective scanning technique which maximizes one's visual capabilities. The probability of spotting a potential collision threat obviously increases with the time spent looking outside the cockpit. Thus, one must use timesharing techniques to efficiently scan the surrounding airspace while monitoring instruments as well.\n\n\nWhile the eyes can observe an approximate 200 degree arc of the horizon at one glance, only a very small center area called the fovea, in the rear of the eye, has the ability to send clear, sharply focused messages to the brain. All other visual information that is not processed directly through the fovea will be of less detail. An aircraft at a distance of 7 miles which appears in sharp focus within the foveal center of vision would have to be as close as 7/10 of a mile in order to be recognized if it were outside of foveal vision. Because the eyes can focus only on this narrow viewing area, effective scanning is accomplished with a series of short, regularly spaced eye movements that bring successive areas of the sky into the central visual field. Each movement should not exceed 10 degrees, and each area should be observed for at least 1 second to enable detection. Although horizontal back\u2010and\u2010forth eye movements seem preferred by most pilots, each pilot should develop a scanning pattern that is most comfortable and then adhere to it to assure optimum scanning.\n\nStudies show that the time a pilot spends on visual tasks inside the cabin should represent no more that 1/4 to 1/3 of the scan time outside, or no more than 4 to 5 seconds on the instrument panel for every 16\u2009seconds outside. Since the brain is already trained to process sight information that is presented from left to right, one may find it easier to start scanning over the left shoulder and proceed across the windshield to the right.\n\nPilots should realize that their eyes may require several seconds to refocus when switching views between items in the cockpit and distant objects. The eyes will also tire more quickly when forced to adjust to distances immediately after close\u2010up focus, as required for scanning the instrument panel. Eye fatigue can be reduced by looking from the instrument panel to the left wing past the wing tip to the center of the first scan quadrant when beginning the exterior scan. After having scanned from left to right, allow the eyes to return to the cabin along the right wing from its tip inward. Once back inside, one should automatically commence the panel scan.\n\nEffective scanning also helps avoid \u201cempty\u2010field myopia.\u201d This condition usually occurs when flying above the clouds or in a haze layer that provides nothing specific to focus on outside the aircraft. This causes the eyes to relax and seek a comfortable focal distance which may range from 10\u2009to 30 feet. For the pilot, this means looking without seeing, which is dangerous."

                "section-content": "Pilots planning to engage in aerobatics should be aware of the physiological stresses associated with accelerative forces during aerobatic maneuvers. Many prospective aerobatic trainees enthusiastically enter aerobatic instruction but find their first experiences with G forces to be unanticipated and very uncomfortable. To minimize or avoid potential adverse effects, the aerobatic instructor and trainee must have a basic understanding of the physiology of G force adaptation.\n\n\nForces experienced with a rapid push\u2010over maneuver result in the blood and body organs being displaced toward the head. Depending on forces involved and individual tolerance, a pilot may experience discomfort, headache, \u201cred\u2010out,\u201d and even unconsciousness.\n\nForces experienced with a rapid pull\u2010up maneuver result in the blood and body organ displacement toward the lower part of the body away from the head. Since the brain requires continuous blood circulation for an adequate oxygen supply, there is a physiologic limit to the time the pilot can tolerate higher forces before losing consciousness. As the blood circulation to the brain decreases as a result of forces involved, a pilot will experience \u201cnarrowing\u201d of visual fields, \u201cgray\u2010out,\u201d \u201cblack\u2010out,\u201d and unconsciousness. Even a brief loss of consciousness in a maneuver can lead to improper control movement causing structural failure of the aircraft or collision with another object or terrain.\n\nIn steep turns, the centrifugal forces tend to push the pilot into the seat, thereby resulting in blood and body organ displacement toward the lower part of the body as in the case of rapid pull\u2010up maneuvers and with the same physiologic effects and symptoms.\n\nPhysiologically, humans progressively adapt to imposed strains and stress, and with practice, any maneuver will have decreasing effect. Tolerance to G\u2009forces is dependent on human physiology and the individual pilot. These factors include the skeletal anatomy, the cardiovascular architecture, the nervous system, the quality of the blood, the general physical state, and experience and recency of exposure. The pilot should consult an Aviation Medical Examiner prior to aerobatic training and be aware that poor physical condition can reduce tolerance to accelerative forces.\n\nThe above information provides pilots with a brief summary of the physiologic effects of G forces. It does not address methods of \u201ccounteracting\u201d these effects. There are numerous references on the subject of G forces during aerobatics available to pilots. Among these are \u201cG Effects on the Pilot During Aerobatics,\u201d FAA-AM-72-28, and \u201cG Incapacitation in Aerobatic Pilots: A Flight Hazard\u201d FAA-AM-82-13.

                "section-content": "Introduction. The most important aspects of vision and the techniques to scan for other aircraft are described in paragraph 8-1-6, Vision in Flight. Pilots should also be familiar with the following information to reduce the possibility of mid\u2010air collisions.\n\n\nDetermining Relative Altitude. Use the horizon as a reference point. If the other aircraft is above the horizon, it is probably on a higher flight path. If the aircraft appears to be below the horizon, it is probably flying at a lower altitude.\n\nTaking Appropriate Action. Pilots should be familiar with rules on right\u2010of\u2010way, so if an aircraft is on an obvious collision course, one can take immediate evasive action, preferably in compliance with applicable Federal Aviation Regulations.\n\nConsider Multiple Threats. The decision to climb, descend, or turn is a matter of personal judgment, but one should anticipate that the other pilot may also be making a quick maneuver. Watch the other aircraft during the maneuver and begin your scanning again immediately since there may be other aircraft in the area.\n\nCollision Course Targets. Any aircraft that appears to have no relative motion and stays in one scan quadrant is likely to be on a collision course. Also, if a target shows no lateral or vertical motion, but increases in size, take evasive action.\n\nRecognize High Hazard Areas.\n\nAirways, especially near VORs, and Class\u2009B, Class C, Class D, and Class E surface areas are places where aircraft tend to cluster.\n\n\nRemember, most collisions occur during days when the weather is good. Being in a \u201cradar environment\u201d still requires vigilance to avoid collisions.\n\nCockpit Management. Studying maps, checklists, and manuals before flight, with other proper preflight planning; e.g., noting necessary radio frequencies and organizing cockpit materials, can reduce the amount of time required to look at these items during flight, permitting more scan time.\n\nWindshield Conditions. Dirty or bug\u2010smeared windshields can greatly reduce the ability of pilots to see other aircraft. Keep a clean windshield.\n\nVisibility Conditions. Smoke, haze, dust, rain, and flying towards the sun can also greatly reduce the ability to detect targets.\n\nVisual Obstructions in the Cockpit.\n\nPilots need to move their heads to see around blind spots caused by fixed aircraft structures, such as door posts, wings, etc. It will be necessary at times to maneuver the aircraft; e.g., lift a wing, to facilitate seeing.\n\n\nPilots must ensure curtains and other cockpit objects; e.g., maps on glare shield, are removed and stowed during flight.\n\nLights On.\n\nDay or night, use of exterior lights can greatly increase the conspicuity of any aircraft.\n\n\nKeep interior lights low at night.\n\nATC Support. ATC facilities often provide radar traffic advisories on a workload\u2010permitting basis. Flight through Class C and Class D airspace requires communication with ATC. Use this support whenever possible or when required."

In an effort to ensure the greatest practical level of safety for all flight operations, the Military Training Route (MTR) program was conceived.\n\n\nThe MTR program is a joint venture by the FAA and the Department of Defense (DoD). MTRs are mutually developed for use by the military for the purpose of conducting low\u2010altitude, high\u2010speed training.

                "section-title": "Temporary Flight Restrictions",
                "section-content": "General. This paragraph describes the types of conditions under which the FAA may impose temporary flight restrictions. It also explains which FAA elements have been delegated authority to issue a temporary flight restrictions NOTAM and lists the types of responsible agencies/offices from which the FAA will accept requests to establish temporary flight restrictions. The 14 CFR is explicit as to what operations are prohibited, restricted, or allowed in a temporary flight restrictions area. Pilots are responsible to comply with 14 CFR Sections 91.137, 91.138, 91.141 and 91.143 when conducting flight in an area where a temporary flight restrictions area is in effect, and should check appropriate NOTAMs during flight planning.\n\n\nThe purpose for establishing a temporary flight restrictions area is to:\n\nProtect persons and property in the air or on the surface from an existing or imminent hazard associated with an incident on the surface when the presence of low flying aircraft would magnify, alter, spread, or compound that hazard (14 CFR Section\u200991.137(a)(1));\n\n\nProvide a safe environment for the operation of disaster relief aircraft (14 CFR Section\u200991.137(a)(2)); or\n\nPrevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft above an incident or event which may generate a high degree of public interest (14 CFR Section\u200991.137(a)(3)).\n\nProtect declared national disasters for humanitarian reasons in the State of Hawaii (14 CFR Section\u200991.138).\n\nProtect the President, Vice President, or other public figures (14 CFR Section 91.141).\n\nProvide a safe environment for space agency operations (14 CFR Section 91.143).\n\nExcept for hijacking situations, when the provisions of 14 CFR Section 91.137(a)(1) or (a)(2) are necessary, a temporary flight restrictions area will only be established by or through the area manager at the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) having jurisdiction over the area concerned. A temporary flight restrictions NOTAM involving the conditions of 14\u2009CFR Section 91.137(a)(3) will be issued at the direction of the service area office director having oversight of the airspace concerned. When hijacking situations are involved, a temporary flight restrictions area will be implemented through the TSA Aviation Command Center. The appropriate FAA air traffic element, upon receipt of such a request, will establish a temporary flight restrictions area under 14\u2009CFR Section\u200991.137(a)(1).\n\nThe FAA accepts recommendations for the establishment of a temporary flight restrictions area under 14\u2009CFR Section 91.137(a)(1) from military major command headquarters, regional directors of the Office of Emergency Planning, Civil Defense State Directors, State Governors, or other similar authority. For the situations involving 14 CFR Section 91.137(a)(2), the FAA accepts recommendations from military commanders serving as regional, subregional, or Search and Rescue (SAR) coordinators; by military commanders directing or coordinating air operations associated with disaster relief; or by civil authorities directing or coordinating organized relief air operations (includes representatives of the Office of Emergency Planning, U.S. Forest Service, and State aeronautical agencies). Appropriate authorities for a temporary flight restrictions establishment under 14 CFR Section\u200991.137(a)(3) are any of those listed above or by State, county, or city government entities.\n\nThe type of restrictions issued will be kept to a minimum by the FAA consistent with achievement of the necessary objective. Situations which warrant the extreme restrictions of 14 CFR Section 91.137(a)(1) include, but are not limited to: toxic gas leaks or spills, flammable agents, or fumes which if fanned by rotor or propeller wash could endanger persons or property on the surface, or if entered by an aircraft could endanger persons or property in the air; imminent volcano eruptions which could endanger airborne aircraft and occupants; nuclear accident or incident; and hijackings. Situations which warrant the restrictions associated with 14 CFR Section\u200991.137(a)(2) include: forest fires which are being fought by releasing fire retardants from aircraft; and aircraft relief activities following a disaster (earthquake, tidal wave, flood, etc.). 14 CFR Section\u200991.137(a)(3) restrictions are established for events and incidents that would attract an unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft.\n\nThe amount of airspace needed to protect persons and property or provide a safe environment for rescue/relief aircraft operations is normally limited to within 2,000 feet above the surface and within a 3-nautical-mile radius. Incidents occurring within Class B, Class C, or Class D airspace will normally be handled through existing procedures and should not require the issuance of a temporary flight restrictions NOTAM. Temporary flight restrictions affecting airspace outside of the U.S. and its territories and possessions are issued with verbiage excluding that airspace outside of the 12-mile coastal limits.\n\nThe FSS nearest the incident site is normally the \u201ccoordination facility.\u201d When FAA communications assistance is required, the designated FSS will function as the primary communications facility for coordination between emergency control authorities and affected aircraft. The ARTCC may act as liaison for the emergency control authorities if adequate communications cannot be established between the designated FSS and the relief organization. For example, the coordination facility may relay authorizations from the on\u2010scene emergency response official in cases where news media aircraft operations are approved at the altitudes used by relief aircraft.\n\nATC may authorize operations in a temporary flight restrictions area under its own authority only when flight restrictions are established under 14 CFR Section 91.137(a)(2) and (a)(3). The appropriate ARTCC/airport traffic control tower manager will, however, ensure that such authorized flights do not hamper activities or interfere with the event for which restrictions were implemented. However, ATC will not authorize local IFR flights into the temporary flight restrictions area.\n\nTo preclude misunderstanding, the implementing NOTAM will contain specific and formatted information. The facility establishing a temporary flight restrictions area will format a NOTAM beginning with the phrase \u201cFLIGHT RESTRICTIONS\u201d followed by: the location of the temporary flight restrictions area; the effective period; the area defined in statute miles; the altitudes affected; the FAA coordination facility and commercial telephone number; the reason for the temporary flight restrictions; the agency directing any relief activities and its commercial telephone number; and other information considered appropriate by the issuing authority.\n\nEXAMPLE-14 CFR Section 91.137(a)(1):\nThe following NOTAM prohibits all aircraft operations except those specified in the NOTAM.\nFlight restrictions Matthews, Virginia, effective immediately until 9610211200.

It is essential that pilots conducting parachute operations be alert, look for other traffic, and exchange traffic information as recommended in paragraph\u20094-1-9, Traffic Advisory Practices at Airports Without Operating Control Towers. In addition, pilots should avoid releasing parachutes while in an airport traffic pattern when there are other aircraft in that pattern. Pilots should make appropriate broadcasts on the designated Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF), and monitor that CTAF until all parachute activity has terminated or the aircraft has left the area. Prior to commencing a jump operation, the pilot should broadcast the aircraft's altitude and position in relation to the airport, the approximate relative time when the jump will commence and terminate, and listen to the position reports of other aircraft in the area."

                "section-content": "VFR Flyways.\n\nVFR Flyways and their associated Flyway Planning Charts were developed from the recommendations of a National Airspace Review Task Group. A VFR Flyway is defined as a general flight path not defined as a specific course, for use by pilots in planning flights into, out of, through or near complex terminal airspace to avoid Class B airspace. An ATC clearance is NOT required to fly these routes.\nFIG 3-5-1VFR Flyway Planning Chart\n\n\nVFR Flyways are depicted on the reverse side of some of the VFR Terminal Area Charts (TAC), commonly referred to as Class B airspace charts. (See FIG 3-5-1.) Eventually all TACs will include a VFR Flyway Planning Chart. These charts identify VFR flyways designed to help VFR pilots avoid major controlled traffic flows. They may further depict multiple VFR routings throughout the area which may be used as an alternative to flight within Class B airspace. The ground references provide a guide for improved visual navigation. These routes are not intended to discourage requests for VFR operations within Class B airspace but are designed solely to assist pilots in planning for flights under and around busy Class B airspace without actually entering Class\u200a\u2009B airspace.\n\nIt is very important to remember that these suggested routes are not sterile of other traffic. The entire Class B airspace, and the airspace underneath it, may be heavily congested with many different types of aircraft. Pilot adherence to VFR rules must be exercised at all times. Further, when operating beneath Class B airspace, communications must be established and maintained between your aircraft and any control tower while transiting the Class B, Class\u2009C, and Class D surface areas of those airports under Class B airspace.\n\n\nVFR Corridors.\n\nThe design of a few of the first Class B airspace areas provided a corridor for the passage of uncontrolled traffic. A VFR corridor is defined as airspace through Class B airspace, with defined vertical and lateral boundaries, in which aircraft may operate without an ATC clearance or communication with air traffic control.\n\n\nThese corridors are, in effect, a \u201chole\u201d through Class B airspace. (See FIG 3-5-2.) A classic example would be the corridor through the Los Angeles Class B airspace, which has been subsequently changed to Special Flight Rules airspace (SFR). A corridor is surrounded on all sides by Class\u2009B airspace and does not extend down to the surface like a VFR Flyway. Because of their finite lateral and vertical limits, and the volume of VFR traffic using a corridor, extreme caution and vigilance must be exercised.\nFIG 3-5-2Class B Airspace\n\nBecause of the heavy traffic volume and the procedures necessary to efficiently manage the flow of traffic, it has not been possible to incorporate VFR corridors in the development or modifications of Class\u2009B airspace in recent years.\n\nClass B Airspace VFR Transition Routes.\n\nTo accommodate VFR traffic through certain Class B airspace, such as Seattle, Phoenix and Los\u2009Angeles, Class B Airspace VFR Transition Routes were developed. A Class B Airspace VFR Transition Route is defined as a specific flight course depicted on a TAC for transiting a specific Class B airspace. These routes include specific ATC\u2010assigned altitudes, and pilots must obtain an ATC clearance prior to entering Class B airspace on the route.\n\n\nThese routes, as depicted in FIG 3-5-3, are designed to show the pilot where to position the aircraft outside of, or clear of, the Class B airspace where an ATC clearance can normally be expected with minimal or no delay. Until ATC authorization is received, pilots must remain clear of Class B airspace. On initial contact, pilots should advise ATC of their position, altitude, route name desired, and direction of flight. After a clearance is received, pilots must fly the route as depicted and, most importantly, adhere to ATC instructions.\nFIG 3-5-3VFR Transition Route"

Part of the Airport Radar Service Area (ARSA) program was to eventually replace all TRSAs. However, the ARSA requirements became relatively stringent and it was subsequently decided that TRSAs would have to meet ARSA criteria before they would be converted. TRSAs do not fit into any of the U.S. airspace classes; therefore, they will continue to be non-Part\u200971 airspace areas where participating pilots can receive additional radar services which have been redefined as TRSA Service.\n\n\nTRSAs.

FAA personnel at flight standards district offices (FSDO) and certificate management offices (CMO) will use the guidance contained in AC\u200990-105 to evaluate an operator's application for RNP 10 or RNP 4 authorization. Authorization to conduct RNP operations in oceanic airspace is provided to all U.S. operators through issuance of Operations Specification (OpSpec), Management Specification (MSpec), or Letter of Authorization (LOA) B036, as applicable to the nature of the operation; for example, Part 121, Part 91, etc. Operators may wish to review FAA Order 8900.1, Flight Standards Information Management System, volume 3, chapter 18, section 4, to understand the specific criteria for issuing OpSpec, MSpec, and/or LOA B036.\n\n\nThe operator's RNP 10 or RNP 4 authorization should include any equipment requirements and RNP\u200910 time limits (if operating solely inertial-based navigation systems), which must be observed when conducting RNP operations. RNP 4 requires tighter navigation and track maintenance accuracy than RNP\u200910."

                "section-content": "Part 107 sUAS. A regulatory first step for civil non-recreational UAS operations. To fly under 14 CFR Part 107, the UAS must weigh less than 55 pounds and the operator (called a remote pilot) must pass a knowledge test. Also, the UAS must be registered. Part 107 enabled the vast majority of routine sUAS operations, allowing flight within VLOS while maintaining flexibility to accommodate future technological innovations. Part 107 allows sUAS operations for many different purposes without requiring airworthiness certification, exemptions, or a COA for Class G airspace access. Part 107 includes the opportunity for individuals to request waivers for certain provisions of the rules, for example, Beyond Visual Line-Of-Sight (BVLOS). Part 107 also has specific restrictions which are not subject to waiver, such as the prohibition of the carriage or transport of Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT).\n\n\nRecreational flyer UAS:\n\nThe FAA considers recreational UAS to be aircraft that fall within the statutory and regulatory definitions of an aircraft, in that they are devices that are used or intended to be used for flight in the air. As aircraft, these devices generally are subject to FAA oversight and enforcement.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\n49 USC 40102, Definitions.\n14 CFR Part 1, Definitions and Abbreviations.\n\n\n\nRecreational aircraft may operate in Class G airspace where the aircraft is flown from the surface to not more than 400 feet AGL, and the operator must comply with all airspace restrictions and prohibitions. The only exception to this altitude restriction in Class G airspace is at FAA- recognized fixed sites and sanctioned events, with specifically approved procedures for flights above 400 feet AGL.\n\nNOTE-\nHigher altitude airspace authorizations for Recreational Flyers are obtained through the FAA's DroneZone website at: https://faadronezone.faa.gov/#/.\n\nThe Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST) module was developed in consultation with multiple UAS stakeholders and through interested party feedback. TRUST is available electronically, has no minimum age limit, and is provided by volunteer test administrators, vetted by the FAA. See AIM, paragraph 11-5-1, UAS Pilot Certification and Requirements for Part 107 and Recreational Flyers, for further information on TRUST. Also, additional information regarding TRUST is available at the FAA's The Recreational UAS Safety Test website.\n\nNOTE-\nThe FAA's The Recreational UAS Safety Test website may be viewed at: https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/knowledge_test_updates/.\n\nRecreational UAS weighing more than .55 lbs must be registered. This can be done electronically through the FAA's DroneZone website. Owners must then label all model aircraft with their assigned registration number on the exterior of their aircraft so that the registration can be clearly seen and read from a reasonable distance. See paragraph 11-2-2, Registration Requirements, for more information on registering UAS.\n\nNOTE-\nThe FAA's DroneZone website may be viewed at: https://faadronezone.faa.gov/#/."

                "section-content": "Nearly all UAS flown in the NAS are required to be registered in the FAA aircraft registration database. UAS weighing 55 pounds MGOW or more must be registered under 14 CFR Part 47, Aircraft Registration, while UAS less than 55 pounds may be registered under the FAA's newer 14 CFR Part 48 online system.\n\nNOTE-\nThe FAA's Aircraft Registration Unmanned Aircraft (UA) website may be viewed at: https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/UA/.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\n14 CFR Part 47, Aircraft Registration.\n\n\n\nRegistering UAS under 14 CFR Part 47. For those UAS, which do not meet the weight stipulations for registration under 14 CFR Part 48, registration is accomplished under 14 CFR Part 47. 14 CFR Part 47 registration will result in an \u201cN\u201d-number like those assigned to manned aircraft. To learn more about the process and to register a UAS under Part 47, see the FAA's Aircraft Registration Unmanned Aircraft (UA) website. If desired by the owner, any UAS may be registered under 14 CFR Part 47.\n\nNOTE-\nThe FAA's Aircraft Registration Unmanned Aircraft (UA) website may be viewed at: https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/UA/.\n\nRegistering UAS under 14 CFR Part 48. For most operators of sUAS (those UAS weighing less than 55 pounds MGOW), registration under 14 CFR Part 48, Registration and Marking Requirements for Small UA, will be most expedient and the least expensive. 14 CFR Part 48 registrants are those UAS flyers operating under either of the following statutes:\n\nPart 107. Under the provisions of Part 107, all UAS must be registered regardless of weight. Operations under Part 107 are generally those involving commerce, but can be for recreation as well.\n\n\nRecreational Flyers. UAS that are flown exclusively for recreational purposes must be registered if they weigh more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams).\n\nNOTE-\nIf you are not sure what kind of a drone flyer you are, refer to the FAA's User Identification Tool at: https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/user_identification_tool/, or visit the FAA Getting Started webpage at:  https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/.Registrations cannot be transferred between 14 CFR Part 107 UAS and 49 USC 44809 UAS.\n\nREFERENCE-\n\n14 CFR Part 48, Registration and Marking Requirements for Small Unmanned Aircraft.\n\n\nHow to register a UAS under 14 CFR Part 48:\n\nTo register a UAS online under Part 48, refer to the FAA's DroneZone website. When registering a UAS online under Part 48, you will need to select registration in either Part 107 or the exception for recreational flyers.\n\n\nRegistration fees for Part 107 registration are per sUAS, and the registration is valid for three years. Each Part 107 registered sUAS will receive a different number. Recreational flyer registration fees are per UAS and valid for three years, but the same registration number can be applied to any UAS in the registrant's ownership. The recreational flyer will receive one registration number that can be used for all UAS flown by that person. In order to register, a person must be 13 years of age or older and be a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident. If the owner is less than 13 years of age, another person 13 years of age or older must register the UAS and that person must be a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident.\n\nAn FAA registration certificate will be issued after UAS registration. The registration certificate (either paper copy or digital copy) must be available for inspection during all flight operations. If an individual other than the registered owner operates a UAS, the registration certificate (either paper copy or digital copy) must also be available for inspection during all flight operations. Federal law requires registered UAS operators, if asked, to show their certificate of registration to any federal, state, or local law enforcement officer. Failure to register a UAS that requires registration may result in regulatory and criminal penalties. The FAA may assess civil penalties up to $27,500.\n\nNOTE-\nThe FAA's DroneZone website may be viewed at: https://faadronezone.faa.gov/#/.\n\nLabeling a UAS with a registration number. All UAS requiring registration must be marked with a registration number before being flown. The UAS registration number can be applied to the aircraft by engraving, a permanent label, or written on with a permanent marker. The registration number must be visible on the outside surface of the UAS."

Flashing aviation red beacons (20 to 40 flashes per minute) and steady burning aviation red lights during nighttime operation. Aviation orange and white paint is used for daytime marking.\n\n\nMedium Intensity Flashing White Obstruction Lights. Medium intensity flashing white obstruction lights may be used during daytime and twilight with automatically selected reduced intensity for nighttime operation. When this system is used on structures 500 feet (153m) AGL or less in height, other methods of marking and lighting the structure may be omitted. Aviation orange and white paint is always required for daytime marking on structures exceeding 500 feet (153m) AGL. This system is not normally installed on structures less than 200 feet (61m) AGL.\n\nHigh Intensity White Obstruction Lights. Flashing high intensity white lights during daytime with reduced intensity for twilight and nighttime operation. When this type system is used, the marking of structures with red obstruction lights and aviation orange and white paint may be omitted.\n\nDual Lighting. A combination of flashing aviation red beacons and steady burning aviation red lights for nighttime operation and flashing high intensity white lights for daytime operation. Aviation orange and white paint may be omitted.\n\nCatenary Lighting. Lighted markers are available for increased night conspicuity of high-voltage (69KV or higher) transmission line catenary wires. Lighted markers provide conspicuity both day and night.\n\n\nMedium intensity omnidirectional flashing white lighting system provides conspicuity both day and night on catenary support structures. The unique sequential/simultaneous flashing light system alerts pilots of the associated catenary wires.\n\nHigh intensity flashing white lights are being used to identify some supporting structures of overhead transmission lines located across rivers, chasms, gorges, etc. These lights flash in a middle, top, lower light sequence at approximately 60 flashes per minute. The top light is normally installed near the top of the supporting structure, while the lower light indicates the approximate lower portion of the wire span. The lights are beamed towards the companion structure and identify the area of the wire span.\n\nHigh intensity flashing white lights are also employed to identify tall structures, such as chimneys and towers, as obstructions to air navigation. The lights provide a 360 degree coverage about the structure at 40 flashes per minute and consist of from one to seven levels of lights depending upon the height of the structure. Where more than one level is used the vertical banks flash simultaneously."
