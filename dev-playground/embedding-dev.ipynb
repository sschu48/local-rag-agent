Although NAVAIDs are monitored by electronic detectors, adverse effects of electronic interference, new obstructions, or changes in terrain near the NAVAID can exist without detection by the ground monitors. Some of the characteristics of malfunction or deteriorating performance which should be reported are: erratic course or bearing indications; intermittent, or full, flag alarm; garbled, missing or obviously improper coded identification; poor quality communications reception; or, in the case of frequency interference, an audible hum or tone accompanying radio communications or NAVAID identification. GNSS problems are often characterized by navigation degradation or service loss indications.

The antenna location for <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receivers used for IFR and VFR operations may differ. VFR antennae are typically placed for convenience more than performance, while IFR installations ensure a clear view is provided with the satellites. Antennae not providing a clear view have a greater opportunity to lose the satellite navigational signal. This is especially true in the case of hand-held <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receivers.

While this method has great utility, the antenna location is limited to the cockpit or cabin which rarely provides a clear view of all available satellites.  Consequently, signal losses may occur due to aircraft structure blocking satellite signals, causing a loss of navigation capability. These losses, coupled with a lack of RAIM capability, could present erroneous position and navigation information with no warning to the pilot.

One of the major improvements is the ability to generate glide path guidance, independent of ground equipment or barometric aiding. This eliminates several problems such as hot and cold temperature effects, incorrect altimeter setting, or lack of a local altimeter source. It also allows approach procedures to be built without the cost of installing ground stations at each airport or runway. Some approach certified receivers may only generate a glide path with performance similar to Baro-VNAV and are only approved to fly the LNAV/VNAV line of minima on the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-r.html#$RNAV\"><span class=\"linked-text\">RNAV</span></a> (<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a>) approach charts.

Once the aircraft is in the GLS flight guidance mode and captures the GLS glidepath, the pilot should fly the GLS final approach segment using the same pilot techniques they use to fly an <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-i.html#$ILS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">ILS</span></a> final approach or the final approach of an <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-r.html#$RNAV\"><span class=\"linked-text\">RNAV</span></a> (<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a>) approach flown to LPV minimums.

The antenna location for <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receivers used for IFR and VFR operations may differ. VFR antennae are typically placed for convenience more than performance, while IFR installations ensure a clear view is provided with the satellites. Antennae not providing a clear view have a greater opportunity to lose the satellite navigational signal. This is especially true in the case of hand-held <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receivers.

While this method has great utility, the antenna location is limited to the cockpit or cabin which rarely provides a clear view of all available satellites.  Consequently, signal losses may occur due to aircraft structure blocking satellite signals, causing a loss of navigation capability. These losses, coupled with a lack of RAIM capability, could present erroneous position and navigation information with no warning to the pilot.

The 24 satellite constellation is designed to ensure at least five satellites are always visible to a user worldwide. A minimum of four satellites is necessary for receivers to establish an accurate three-dimensional position. The receiver uses data from satellites above the mask angle (the lowest angle above the horizon at which a receiver can use a satellite). The Department of Defense (DoD) is responsible for operating the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> satellite constellation and monitors the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> satellites to ensure proper operation. Each satellite's orbital parameters (ephemeris data) are sent to each satellite for broadcast as part of the data message embedded in the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> signal.

       " In order for RAIM to determine if a satellite is providing corrupted information, at least one satellite, in addition to those required for navigation, must be in view for the receiver to perform the RAIM function. RAIM requires a minimum of 5 satellites, or 4 satellites and barometric altimeter input (baro-aiding), to detect an integrity anomaly. Baro-aiding is a method of augmenting the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> integrity solution by using a non-satellite input source in lieu of the fifth satellite.

This allows the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receiver to isolate the corrupt satellite signal, remove it from the position solution, and still provide an integrity-assured position. To ensure that baro-aiding is available, enter the current altimeter setting into the receiver as described in the operating manual.

The antenna location for <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receivers used for IFR and VFR operations may differ. VFR antennae are typically placed for convenience more than performance, while IFR installations ensure a clear view is provided with the satellites. Antennae not providing a clear view have a greater opportunity to lose the satellite navigational signal. This is especially true in the case of hand-held <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receivers.

While this method has great utility, the antenna location is limited to the cockpit or cabin which rarely provides a clear view of all available satellites.  Consequently, signal losses may occur due to aircraft structure blocking satellite signals, causing a loss of navigation capability. These losses, coupled with a lack of RAIM capability, could present erroneous position and navigation information with no warning to the pilot.

This prevents the pilot from being alerted to the loss of the required number of satellites in view, or the detection of a position error. Pilots should use a systematic cross-check with other navigation techniques to verify position. Be suspicious of the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> position if a disagreement exists between the two positions.\n",

However, there is no requirement for databases to be updated for VFR navigation. It is not recommended to use a moving map with an outdated database in and around critical airspace. Pilots using an outdated database should verify waypoints using current aeronautical products; for example, Chart Supplement, Sectional Chart, or En Route Chart.\n",

The antenna location for <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receivers used for IFR and VFR operations may differ. VFR antennae are typically placed for convenience more than performance, while IFR installations ensure a clear view is provided with the satellites. Antennae not providing a clear view have a greater opportunity to lose the satellite navigational signal. This is especially true in the case of hand-held <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receivers. Typically, suction cups are used to place the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> antennas on the inside of cockpit windows. While this method has great utility, the antenna location is limited to the cockpit or cabin which rarely provides a clear view of all available satellites.  Consequently, signal losses may occur due to aircraft structure blocking satellite signals, causing a loss of navigation capability. These losses, coupled with a lack of RAIM capability, could present erroneous position and navigation information with no warning to the pilot. While the use of a hand-held <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> for VFR operations is not limited by regulation, modification of the aircraft, such as installing a panel- or yoke-mounted holder, is governed by 14 CFR Part 43.

The uses of VFR waypoints include providing navigational aids for pilots unfamiliar with an area, waypoint definition of existing reporting points, enhanced navigation in and around Class B and Class C airspace, enhanced navigation around Special Use Airspace, and entry points for commonly flown mountain passes. VFR pilots should rely on appropriate and current aeronautical charts published specifically for visual navigation. If operating in a terminal area, pilots should take advantage of the Terminal Area Chart available for that area, if published.

These differences are due to the magnetic variance used to calculate the magnetic course. Every leg of an instrument procedure is first computed along a desired ground track with reference to true north. A magnetic variation correction is then applied to the true course in order to calculate a magnetic course for publication. The type of procedure will determine what magnetic variation value is added to the true course. A ground-based NAVAID IFP applies the facility magnetic variation of record to the true course to get the charted magnetic course. Magnetic courses on <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-p.html#$PBN\"><span class=\"linked-text\">PBN</span></a> procedures are calculated two different ways. <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-s.html#$SID\"><span class=\"linked-text\">SID</span></a>/<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-s.html#$STAR\"><span class=\"linked-text\">STAR</span></a> procedures use the airport magnetic variation of record, while IFR enroute charts use magnetic reference bearing. <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-p.html#$PBN\"><span class=\"linked-text\">PBN</span></a> systems make a correction to true north by adding a magnetic variation calculated with an algorithm based on aircraft position, or by adding the magnetic variation coded in their navigational database. This may result in the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-p.html#$PBN\"><span class=\"linked-text\">PBN</span></a> system and the procedure designer using a different magnetic variation, which causes the magnetic course <strong><em>displayed</em> </strong>by the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-p.html#$PBN\"><span class=\"linked-text\">PBN</span></a> system and the magnetic course <strong><em>charted</em> </strong>on the IFP plate to be different. It is important to understand, however, that <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-p.html#$PBN\"><span class=\"linked-text\">PBN</span></a> systems, (with the exception of VOR/DME RNAV equipment) navigate by reference to true north and display magnetic course only for pilot reference. As such, a <strong><em>properly functioning</em> </strong><a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-p.html#$PBN\"><span class=\"linked-text\">PBN</span></a> system, containing a <strong><em>current and accurate navigational database</em></strong>, should fly the correct ground track for any loaded instrument procedure, despite differences in displayed magnetic course that may be attributed to magnetic variation application.

One of the major improvements is the ability to generate glide path guidance, independent of ground equipment or barometric aiding. This eliminates several problems such as hot and cold temperature effects, incorrect altimeter setting, or lack of a local altimeter source. It also allows approach procedures to be built without the cost of installing ground stations at each airport or runway. Some approach certified receivers may only generate a glide path with performance similar to Baro-VNAV and are only approved to fly the LNAV/VNAV line of minima on the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-r.html#$RNAV\"><span class=\"linked-text\">RNAV</span></a> (<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a>) approach charts.

It also provides vertical integrity monitoring, which bounds the vertical error to 50 meters for LNAV/VNAV and LPVs with minima of 250' or above, and bounds the vertical error to 35 meters for LPVs with minima below 250'.\n",

For example, if an approach is published with LPV minima and the receiver is only certified for LNAV/VNAV, the equipment would indicate “LNAV/VNAV available,” even though the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-w.html#$WAAS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">WAAS</span></a> signal would support LPV. If flying an existing LNAV/VNAV procedure with no LPV minima, the receiver will notify the pilot “LNAV/VNAV available,” even if the receiver is certified for LPV and the signal supports LPV. If the signal does not support vertical guidance on procedures with LPV and/or LNAV/VNAV minima, the receiver annunciation will read “LNAV available.” On lateral only procedures with LP and LNAV minima the receiver will indicate “LP available” or “LNAV available” based on the level of lateral service available. Once the level of service notification has been given, the receiver will operate in this mode for the duration of the approach procedure, unless that level of service becomes unavailable.

The width of the final approach course is tailored so that the total width is usually 700 feet at the runway threshold. Since the origin point of the lateral splay for the angular portion of the final is not fixed due to antenna placement like localizer, the splay angle can remain fixed, making a consistent width of final for aircraft being vectored onto the final approach course on different length runways.

Two differences occur here. First, the scaling abruptly changes from the approach scaling to the missed approach scaling, at approximately the departure end of the runway or when the pilot selects missed approach guidance rather than ramping as <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> does.

One of the major improvements is the ability to generate glide path guidance, independent of ground equipment or barometric aiding. This eliminates several problems such as hot and cold temperature effects, incorrect altimeter setting, or lack of a local altimeter source. It also allows approach procedures to be built without the cost of installing ground stations at each airport or runway. Some approach certified receivers may only generate a glide path with performance similar to Baro-VNAV and are only approved to fly the LNAV/VNAV line of minima on the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-r.html#$RNAV\"><span class=\"linked-text\">RNAV</span></a> (<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a>) approach charts. Receivers with additional capability (including faster update rates and smaller integrity limits) are approved to fly the LPV line of minima. The lateral integrity changes dramatically from the 0.3 NM (556 meter) limit for <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a>, LNAV, and LNAV/VNAV approach mode, to 40 meters for LPV. It also provides vertical integrity monitoring, which bounds the vertical error to 50 meters for LNAV/VNAV and LPVs with minima of 250' or above, and bounds the vertical error to 35 meters for LPVs with minima below 250'.\n",

For example, if an approach is published with LPV minima and the receiver is only certified for LNAV/VNAV, the equipment would indicate “LNAV/VNAV available,” even though the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-w.html#$WAAS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">WAAS</span></a> signal would support LPV. If flying an existing LNAV/VNAV procedure with no LPV minima, the receiver will notify the pilot “LNAV/VNAV available,” even if the receiver is certified for LPV and the signal supports LPV. If the signal does not support vertical guidance on procedures with LPV and/or LNAV/VNAV minima, the receiver annunciation will read “LNAV available.” On lateral only procedures with LP and LNAV minima the receiver will indicate “LP available” or “LNAV available” based on the level of lateral service available. Once the level of service notification has been given, the receiver will operate in this mode for the duration of the approach procedure, unless that level of service becomes unavailable.

The width of the final approach course is tailored so that the total width is usually 700 feet at the runway threshold.

It also allows approach procedures to be built without the cost of installing ground stations at each airport or runway.

However, despite the unique service volume, in the final approach segment, a GLS approach provides precise 3D angular lateral and vertical guidance mimicking the precision guidance of an <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-i.html#$ILS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">ILS</span></a> approach.\n",

Once on the GLS final approach course, the pilot should ensure the aircraft is in the GLS approach mode prior to reaching the procedure's glidepath intercept point. Once the aircraft is in the GLS flight guidance mode and captures the GLS glidepath, the pilot should fly the GLS final approach segment using the same pilot techniques they use to fly an <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-i.html#$ILS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">ILS</span></a> final approach or the final approach of an <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-r.html#$RNAV\"><span class=\"linked-text\">RNAV</span></a> (<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a>) approach flown to LPV minimums.

       " The FAA publishes Standard Service Volumes (SSVs) for most NAVAIDs. The SSV is a three-dimensional volume within which the FAA ensures that a signal can be received with adequate signal strength and course quality, and is free from interference from other NAVAIDs on similar frequencies (e.g., co-channel or adjacent-channel interference). However, the SSV signal protection does not include potential blockage from terrain or obstructions. The SSV is principally intended for off-route navigation, such as proceeding direct to or from a VOR when not on a published instrument procedure or route. Navigation on published instrument procedures (e.g., approaches or departures) or routes (e.g., Victor routes) may use NAVAIDs outside of the SSV, when Extended Service Volume (ESV) is approved, since adequate signal strength, course quality, and freedom from interference are verified by the FAA prior to the publishing of the instrument procedure or route.\n",

Pilots must understand the limitations of the receivers prior to using in flight to avoid misusing navigation information. (See <a href=\"#ffAks301atcn\">TBL 1-1-6</a>.)

       " <ol class=\"list-style-type-decimal\"><li>\n",
       " RAIM Capability. VFR GPS panel mount receivers and hand-held units have no RAIM alerting capability. This prevents the pilot from being alerted to the loss of the required number of satellites in view, or the detection of a position error. Pilots should use a systematic cross-check with other navigation techniques to verify position. Be suspicious of the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> position if a disagreement exists between the two positions.\n",

However, there is no requirement for databases to be updated for VFR navigation. It is not recommended to use a moving map with an outdated database in and around critical airspace. Pilots using an outdated database should verify waypoints using current aeronautical products; for example, Chart Supplement, Sectional Chart, or En Route Chart.\n",

The antenna location for <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receivers used for IFR and VFR operations may differ. VFR antennae are typically placed for convenience more than performance, while IFR installations ensure a clear view is provided with the satellites. Antennae not providing a clear view have a greater opportunity to lose the satellite navigational signal. This is especially true in the case of hand-held <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receivers. Typically, suction cups are used to place the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> antennas on the inside of cockpit windows. While this method has great utility, the antenna location is limited to the cockpit or cabin which rarely provides a clear view of all available satellites.  Consequently, signal losses may occur due to aircraft structure blocking satellite signals, causing a loss of navigation capability. These losses, coupled with a lack of RAIM capability, could present erroneous position and navigation information with no warning to the pilot. While the use of a hand-held <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> for VFR operations is not limited by regulation, modification of the aircraft, such as installing a panel- or yoke-mounted holder, is governed by 14 CFR Part 43.

VFR pilots should rely on appropriate and current aeronautical charts published specifically for visual navigation.

This may result in the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-p.html#$PBN\"><span class=\"linked-text\">PBN</span></a> system and the procedure designer using a different magnetic variation, which causes the magnetic course <strong><em>displayed</em> </strong>by the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-p.html#$PBN\"><span class=\"linked-text\">PBN</span></a> system and the magnetic course <strong><em>charted</em> </strong>on the IFP plate to be different.

Pilots should use a systematic cross-check with other navigation techniques to verify position.

The antenna location for <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receivers used for IFR and VFR operations may differ. VFR antennae are typically placed for convenience more than performance, while IFR installations ensure a clear view is provided with the satellites. Antennae not providing a clear view have a greater opportunity to lose the satellite navigational signal. This is especially true in the case of hand-held <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> receivers. Typically, suction cups are used to place the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> antennas on the inside of cockpit windows. While this method has great utility, the antenna location is limited to the cockpit or cabin which rarely provides a clear view of all available satellites.  Consequently, signal losses may occur due to aircraft structure blocking satellite signals, causing a loss of navigation capability. These losses, coupled with a lack of RAIM capability, could present erroneous position and navigation information with no warning to the pilot. While the use of a hand-held <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> for VFR operations is not limited by regulation, modification of the aircraft, such as installing a panel- or yoke-mounted holder, is governed by 14 CFR Part 43.

These differences are due to the magnetic variance used to calculate the magnetic course. Every leg of an instrument procedure is first computed along a desired ground track with reference to true north. A magnetic variation correction is then applied to the true course in order to calculate a magnetic course for publication. The type of procedure will determine what magnetic variation value is added to the true course. A ground-based NAVAID IFP applies the facility magnetic variation of record to the true course to get the charted magnetic course.

Eventually, all CNFs will begin with the letters “CF” followed by three consonants (for example, CFWBG). This five-letter identifier will be found next to an “x” on enroute charts and possibly on an approach chart. On instrument approach procedures (charts) in the terminal procedures publication, CNFs may represent unnamed <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-d.html#$DME\"><span class=\"linked-text\">DME</span></a> fixes, beginning and ending points of <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-d.html#$DME\"><span class=\"linked-text\">DME</span></a> arcs, and sensor (ground-based signal i.e., VOR, NDB, ILS) final approach fixes on <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a> overlay approaches.

Fly-by waypoints connect the two segments by allowing the aircraft to turn prior to the current waypoint in order to roll out on course to the next waypoint.

Pilots are not to use CNFs for point to point navigation (proceed direct), filing a flight plan, or in aircraft/ATC communications. CNFs that do appear on aeronautical charts allow pilots increased situational awareness by identifying points in the aircraft database route of flight with points on the aeronautical chart. CNFs are random five-letter identifiers, not pronounceable like waypoints and placed in parenthesis.

One of the major improvements is the ability to generate glide path guidance, independent of ground equipment or barometric aiding. This eliminates several problems such as hot and cold temperature effects, incorrect altimeter setting, or lack of a local altimeter source. It also allows approach procedures to be built without the cost of installing ground stations at each airport or runway. Some approach certified receivers may only generate a glide path with performance similar to Baro-VNAV and are only approved to fly the LNAV/VNAV line of minima on the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-r.html#$RNAV\"><span class=\"linked-text\">RNAV</span></a> (<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/pcg_html/glossary-g.html#$GPS\"><span class=\"linked-text\">GPS</span></a>) approach charts.

If the signal does not support vertical guidance on procedures with LPV and/or LNAV/VNAV minima, the receiver annunciation will read “LNAV available.” On lateral only procedures with LP and LNAV minima the receiver will indicate “LP available” or “LNAV available” based on the level of lateral service available.

The width of the final approach course is tailored so that the total width is usually 700 feet at the runway threshold. Since the origin point of the lateral splay for the angular portion of the final is not fixed due to antenna placement like localizer, the splay angle can remain fixed, making a consistent width of final for aircraft being vectored onto the final approach course on different length runways.

The width of the final approach course is tailored so that the total width is usually 700 feet at the runway threshold. Since the origin point of the lateral splay for the angular portion of the final is not fixed due to antenna placement like localizer, the splay angle can remain fixed, making a consistent width of final for aircraft being vectored onto the final approach course on different length runways.

The width of the final approach course is tailored so that the total width is usually 700 feet at the runway threshold. Since the origin point of the lateral splay for the angular portion of the final is not fixed due to antenna placement like localizer, the splay angle can remain fixed, making a consistent width of final for aircraft being vectored onto the final approach course on different length runways.

Two differences occur here.
