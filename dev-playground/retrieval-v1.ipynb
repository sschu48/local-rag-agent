This AC provides guidance for  pilot and instructor applicants, pilots, flight instructors, ground instructors, and examiners  on certification standards, knowledge test procedures, and other requirements in Title 14  of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 61.  2 AUDIENCE. The primary audience for this AC is all flight instructors, ground  instructors, and Designated Pilot Examiners (DPE). It includes applicants for pilot  certificates, flight instructor certificates, and ground instructor certificates. The audience  also includes aviation safety inspectors (ASI) and aviation safety technicians (AST) who  conduct certification functions for pilots and/or have oversight of a designee who  performs pilot or instructor certifications. The secondary audience includes Flight  Standards Service offices. Title 14 CFR Part 107, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems,  operators should refer to AC 107-2, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS), for  certificate requirements.  3 SAFETY MESSAGE. Safety is the number one goal of all airmen and instructors. This  AC is an aviation safety resource that helps avoid risk. Endorsements represent training  requirements completed and privileges granted. This AC helps airmen and instructors  ensure that all training is completed and documented clearly and concisely. An  endorsement marks and formalizes events such as an operating privilege or authorization  granted or a limitation incurred. Applying the recommended endorsements reduces the  risk that someone will act without a prerequisite or will misunderstand a limitation.  4 WHERE YOU CAN FIND THIS AC. You can find this AC on the Federal Aviation  Administration’s (FAA) website at http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_cir culars.  5 WHAT THIS AC CANCELS.

See Appendix B, Summary of Changes, for changes from  this AC’s previous edition.  8 PILOT TRAINING AND TESTING. Part 61 contains eligibility, aeronautical  knowledge, flight proficiency, and aeronautical experience requirements for each pilot  certificate, instrument rating, flight instructor certificate, and ground instructor certificate.  The Areas of Operation specified for each certificate by part 61 encompass the Areas of  Operation and tasks contained in the ACS or PTS, as appropriate. Instructors must train  applicants “ to acceptable standards in all subject matter areas, procedures, and  maneuvers included in the tasks within the appropriate practical test standard.”  9 KNOWLEDGE TESTS. Airman knowledge tests cover the aeronautical knowledge  areas prescribed in part 61.  9.1 Knowledge Test Administration. An applicant for a knowledge test must meet the  requirements detailed in part 61, § 61.35(a). For the location of computerized testing  centers, consult the list at http://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/.  9.2 Evidence of Completion. Applicants are not required to show evidence of completed  training to take flight instructor, ground instructor, military competency, or foreign pilot  instrument knowledge tests unless they are applying to retake a test after failing that test  per § 61.49. A person who applies for the knowledge test for an Airline Transport Pilot  (ATP) Certificate with an airplane category and multiengine class rating must present a  graduation certificate from an authorized training provider, as prescribed in § 61.156.  Applicants for other ATP knowledge tests are not required to show evidence of  completed training unless they are applying to retake a test after failing that test.  9.3 Relief for Certain U.S. Military and Civilian Personnel. Special rules, Special Federal  Aviation Regulations (SFAR) 100-2 and § 61.199(a)(3), grant relief to U.S. military and  civilian personnel who are assigned outside the United States in support of U.S. Armed  Forces operations. ASIs and ASTs are authorized to accept, from an eligible person, an  expired flight instructor certificate for renewal of that certificate or to obtain a new  instructor privilege on that certificate. ASIs and ASTs are also authorized to accept an  expired knowledge test report to show eligibility under part 61 to take a practical test.  The eligible person must present the ASI or AST with the required documents along with  FAA Form 8710-1, Airman Certificate and/or Rating Application. Refer to SFAR 100-2  and §§ 61.197 and 61.199(a)(3).'},\n",

The FAA Airman Testing website contains detailed information about all  airman tests. Refer to https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/.  2. The AKT regulations are §§ 61.35 and 61.37. Refer to the FAA AKT website  at https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/media/testing_matrix.pdf.  10.2 Home Study Curriculum. Except for applicants for an ATP Certificate with an airplane  category and multiengine class rating, applicants may obtain ground training for the  knowledge test from pilot schools, colleges, aviation organizations, and individual flight  or ground instructors. Home study curricula are available from representatives of the  aviation industry. Students may develop an individual home study curriculum compiled  from material described in the applicable FAA airman knowledge test guide. The student,  to show evidence of a ground school or home study curriculum completion, may use any  one of the following methods:  1. A certificate of graduation from a pilot training course conducted by an  FAA-certificated pilot school, appropriate to the certificate or rating sought, or  a statement of accomplishment from the school certifying satisfactory  completion of the ground school portion of the course.  2. An endorsement from an authorized instructor who has certified that the  applicant has satisfactorily completed the ground training required for the  certificate or rating sought and is prepared for the test.  3. A certificate of graduation or statement of accomplishment from a ground  school course, appropriate to the certificate and rating sought, that was  conducted by an agency such as a high school, college, adult education  program, the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), or a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps  (ROTC) flight training program.  4. A certificate of graduation from an industry-provided aviation home study  course. The aeronautical enterprise providing the study material must develop  the certificate. The certificate of graduation must correspond to the FAA  knowledge test for the certificate or rating sought. The aeronautical enterprise  providing the course of study must also furnish a comprehensive knowledge  test, which the course provider can score as evidence that the student has  completed the course of study. The knowledge test must be sent to the course  provider for scoring. Upon satisfactory completion of the examination, a  graduation certificate signed by an authorized certificated flight instructor  (CFI) of the course provider will be provided to the student.  5. Applicants are encouraged to obtain ground training using one of the methods  described in items 1 through 4 above. An applicant who is unable to provide  any of the above documents may present an individually developed home  study course to an appropriately certificated flight or ground instructor. The  instructor will review the course materials and question the applicant to'},\n",

Applicants for knowledge tests and airman certificates must provide  positive proof of identification, address, age, and meet English language standards at the  time of application.  11.1 Identification. Applicants must present unexpired, official government-issued  identification that contains the applicant’s photograph and the applicant’s signature.  The applicant may present this information in more than one form of identification.  Refer to the AKT website at https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/media/testing_ matrix.pdf for more information on acceptable identification.  11.2 Address. A mailing address for delivery of the applicant’s certificate may be indicated on  FAA Form 8710-1 or FAA Form 8710-11, Airman Certificate and/or Rating  Application – Sport Pilot, as appropriate. However, the residential address required for  official record purposes for a certificate must be provided to specify the airman’s actual  permanent residential street number, city, state, and ZIP code, including apartment  number, where appropriate. The airman can specify an address to be printed on the  permanent airman certificate, if different than the applicant’s current address. If the  applicant has a foreign address, the country must be stated. If a residential address does  not exist, the applicant must provide and attach to the application the geographic location  of his or her residence on a separate piece of paper and attest by signature. This can be in  the form of a map or written directions to the applicant’s physical residential address. An  applicant who resides on a boat must provide the boat dock number or vessel registration  number. If the applicant resides in a recreational vehicle (RV), the state in which the RV  is registered, the registration number, and the vehicle identification number (VIN) should  be included. The supporting paperwork is submitted as part of the applicant’s application.  11.3 Age. Applicants applying for a Student Pilot Certificate, knowledge test, and practical  test must show they meet the minimum age requirement for the certificate sought. In the  case of an applicant under the age of 18 years, the applicant’s parent or guardian may  have to accompany the applicant and identify themselves in accordance with regular  application procedures. If the parent or guardian attests to the applicant’s identity, the  parent or guardian’s photograph identification information should be placed on the  “Airman’s Identification (ID)” block of the “Attachments” section of FAA Form 8710-1,  and a remark added indicating the parent’s identification was used if the applicant is  applying for a Student Pilot Certificate. When applying to take a knowledge test,  applicants must show that they will meet the minimum age requirement for the certificate  sought within 24 calendar-months of the date of application for the knowledge test, with  the exception of those pilots applying for the ATP multiengine airplane knowledge test.  However, in accordance with § 61.35(a)(3), an applicant for the ATP multiengine  airplane knowledge test must be at least 18 years of age.'},\n",

Training facilities and individuals authorized to conduct evaluations, training, testing,  checking, or certification activities all share the responsibility to ensure that all applicants  for an FAA certificate or individuals who hold FAA certificates continually demonstrate  that they meet the FAA regulatory English language eligibility requirements. If there is a  question that the applicant or certificated individual may not meet the FAA regulatory  English language eligibility requirements to obtain or hold an FAA certificate, refer to  AC 60-28 and FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 5, Chapter 14, FAA English Language  Standard for Certification Under 14 CFR Parts 61, 63, 65, and 107, for guidance.  11.4.2 Flight Review or Instrument Proficiency Check (IPC). If the pilot does not meet the FAA  Aviation English Language Standard (AELS) during a flight review or IPC, do not  endorse the pilot’s logbook or training record as complete. Provide a logbook entry for  the training received, advise the pilot, and contact the responsible Flight Standards  District Office (FSDO).  11.4.3 Student Pilot. Before accepting an application for certification, to include processing an  application for a Student Pilot Certificate or issuing an endorsement for solo operations  or a practical test, the applicant must be evaluated in accordance with the guidelines  contained in AC 60-28, Appendix A, FAA English Language Standard Evaluation.  11.4.4 Evaluators. AELS evaluators should develop multiple plans of action, as described  in AC 60-28, to conduct an FAA AELS evaluation. This will ensure that their evaluation  does not become predictable. Also, AELS evaluators must access the following  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) language proficiency website  that provides audio of the various ICAO English language levels in order to  familiarize themselves with the ICAO English Language Proficiency (ELP) operational  levels so they can best accomplish the FAA AELS evaluation: http://cfapp.icao.int/rssta/ RSSTA.cfm.  12 PRACTICAL TESTS.  12.1 General. A practical test is conducted to evaluate the applicant’s knowledge, skill, and  management of risk for the pilot certificate and rating sought. During a practical test, the  examiner will evaluate the applicant based on oral examination and observation of  performance-based skills in accordance with the appropriate ACS or PTS. However, the  examiner may use oral testing at any time during the practical test. An examiner is  responsible for determining whether the applicant meets the standards outlined in the  objective of each required task evaluated in accordance with the appropriate ACS or PTS.  Refer to the appropriate ACS or PTS for more information.'},\n",

       "  'text': '8/27/18    AC 61-65H  6  12.2 PTS Requirements. The PTS requires testing through oral or written questions and by  demonstrating piloting skills. Until these standards are replaced by the ACS, the PTS will  continue to be the standards document.  12.3 ACS Requirements. For elements associated with tasks in the ACS, similar language is  used in the objective as stated above for the PTS; however, the ACS evaluates  knowledge, risk management, and skill elements for each task. Each element uses  language to clarify whether the evaluation will be accomplished through oral or  performance evaluation.  12.4 Use of Full Flight Simulators (FFS) and Flight Training Devices (FTD). In  accordance with §§ 61.45(a) and 61.64, an FFS or FTD may be used for some or all of  the practical test as authorized through an FAA-approved testing or checking program or  curriculum. Use of an Aviation Training Device (ATD) is not authorized on a practical  test for a certificate or rating or for an aircraft type rating. Additional information on the  use of an FFS, FTD, or ATD can be found in the appropriate ACS or PTS.  12.5 Two Calendar-Months or 60 Calendar-Days. An applicant has two time limits that  apply to the certification practical test. What appears to be a conflict in the regulations  with reference to these time limits is not a conflict. Apply the time limits as written in the  regulations.  • Time Limit 60 Calendar-Days. Section 61.43(f) states that if a practical test is  discontinued, as defined in § 61.43(e), the applicant is entitled to credit for those  areas of operation that were passed, but only if the applicant complies with  § 61.43(f)(1)–(4). The examiner or applicant may discontinue a practical test at any  time when the applicant fails one or more of the areas of operation or due to  inclement weather conditions, aircraft airworthiness, or any other safety-of-flight  concern. Section 61.43(f)(1) states that the applicant must pass “the remainder of the  practical test within the 60 calendar-day period after the date the practical test was  discontinued” to use that credit. After the 60 calendar-day period, credit no longer  applies and all areas of operation must be tested. A test may be discontinued for  failure of an area of operation or for safety of flight.  • Time Limit 2 Calendar-Months. Section 61.39(f) states that all increments,  ground/oral and flight, of practical tests must be completed within 2 calendar-months.  The increment may be because the test was discontinued for reasons stated in  § 61.43(e), or was planned to be conducted in increments. This is a separate time limit  from the 60 calendar-day limit prescribed above that applies to credit for tasks passed.  13 LIGHT-SPORT AIRCRAFT (LSA) WITH A SINGLE SEAT.  13.1 General. In accordance with § 61.45(f), a practical test may be conducted in an LSA that  has a single seat. The FAA believes that with certain limitations, it is appropriate to allow  the practical test for a sport pilot certificate only. This provision does not allow a  practical test for a flight instructor certificate or recreational pilot certificate or higher to  be conducted in an LSA that has a single pilot seat.'},\n",

       "  'text': '8/27/18    AC 61-65H  7  13.2 Testing From the Ground. With certain limitations, a DPE or an FAA ASI may conduct  the practical test for a sport pilot certificate in an LSA having a single seat. Refer to  § 61.45(f) for specific provisions. The examiner must agree to conduct the test  (§ 61.45(f)(1)) and must conduct the practical test in accordance with the sport pilot PTS  or ACS, as appropriate. Knowledge of all tasks applicable to their category/class of  aircraft will be evaluated orally. The examiner must be in a position to observe the  operation of the aircraft while evaluating the proficiency of the applicant (§ 61.45(f)(2)).  13.3 Single-Seat Limitation. The limitation, “No passenger carriage and flight in a single-seat  light-sport aircraft only,” will be placed on the person’s pilot certificate per § 61.45(f)(3).  Only a DPE or an ASI is authorized to remove this limitation. The DPE or ASI can  accomplish this when the sport pilot takes a practical test in a two-place LSA and  conducts the additional tasks identified in the ACS or PTS, as appropriate. This practical  test may be conducted in the same or additional category of aircraft. Upon successful  completion of the practical test, the DPE or ASI will remove the limitation and the sport  pilot is authorized to act as pilot in command (PIC) in all categories of LSA for which the  sport pilot has an endorsement. The DPE or ASI can also remove the limitation if the  sport pilot completes the certification requirements in an aircraft with a minimum of  two places for a higher certificate or rating.  13.4 Flight Review. A sport pilot whose certificate has a single-seat limitation must complete  a flight review, as required by § 61.56. The flight review must be in an aircraft with a  minimum of two pilot stations, in which the pilot is rated, and with an authorized  instructor who is current and qualified to act as PIC.  13.5 Additional Category or Class. An instructor may perform a proficiency check for an  additional category or class in accordance with §§ 61.45(f) and 61.321 to be added to a  sport pilot certificate or higher using a single-seat LSA, provided the instructor is also a  DPE or an ASI. The instructor or ASI must agree to conduct the proficiency check in a  single-seat LSA, and must ensure that the proficiency check is conducted in accordance  with the sport pilot PTS or ACS, as appropriate, for single-seat aircraft. The instructor  will evaluate knowledge of all tasks applicable to the category or class of aircraft orally.  Those pilots seeking sport pilot privileges in a single-seat LSA must demonstrate  competency in those specific tasks identified in the appropriate ACS or PTS and any  other tasks selected by the instructor. On successful completion of the proficiency check,  the instructor or ASI will issue an endorsement with the following limitation: “No  passenger carriage and flight in a single-pilot station aircraft only (add category/class),”  limiting the pilot’s operations to a single-seat aircraft in this category and class. The  instructor must sign this endorsement with his or her flight instructor and examiner  number.  13.6 Remove Limitation. This limitation can be removed once the pilot has successfully  completed a proficiency check involving the additional tasks identified in the appropriate  ACS or PTS in a two-pilot station LSA for the specific category and class rating sought  and in accordance with § 61.321. The proficiency check must be conducted in the same  category and class of LSA. Upon successful completion of the proficiency check, the  pilot will be issued an endorsement for the LSA privilege sought.'},\n",

Except as provided by § 61.39, each  applicant must have received an endorsement from an authorized instructor who certified  that the applicant received and logged the required flight time/training in preparation for  the practical test within 2 calendar-months preceding the month of the application and  has been found proficient to pass the practical test. If an endorsement is required, it must  also state that the applicant has satisfactory knowledge of the subject areas in which he or  she was shown to be deficient by the FAA Airman Knowledge Test Report (AKTR).  14.1 Endorsements. All applicants must have the required endorsements specified in part 61  for the aircraft category, class, and/or type rating. A graduate of a 14 CFR part 141 pilot  school who takes the certification practical test with an examiner must have the  endorsements required by § 61.39(a) to take the practical test.  14.2 Testing Following a Notice of Disapproval. All applicants who apply for retest of a  practical test after being issued a Notice of Disapproval must present another  endorsement from their instructor in accordance with §§ 61.43(f) and 61.49(a)(2). The  endorsement must state that the applicant has received the necessary training and is  prepared for the practical test. An instructor’s recommendation on FAA Form 8710-1 is  required for each retest following a Notice of Disapproval conducted for a certificate or  rating. The applicant may receive credit for those Areas of Operation that the applicant  passed, but only if the applicant passes the remainder of the practical test within the  60 calendar-day period after the date the practical test was discontinued.  14.3 Testing Following a Letter of Discontinuance. No additional endorsements are required  for an applicant to continue the practical test after being issued a Letter of  Discontinuance. The applicant is entitled to credit for those Areas of Operation that were  passed, but only if the applicant passes the remainder of the test within the  60 calendar-day period after the date the practical test was discontinued. If more than  60 calendar-days has passed, the applicant must accomplish the entire practical test.  14.4 Medical Certificate. For detail on medical requirements, refer to 14 CFR parts 61, 67,  and 68, and AC 68-1, BasicMed.  15 STUDENT PILOT CERTIFICATION. Specific knowledge, flight proficiency, flight  experience, and endorsement requirements for the Student Pilot Certificate are located in  part 61 subpart C.  15.1 Student Pilot Certification Application and Issuance. A person may apply for a  Student Pilot Certificate with one of the following authorized individuals: a CFI, a DPE,  an FAA ASI or AST, or an Airman Certification Representative (ACR) associated with a  part 141 pilot school. The FAA Civil Aviation Registry issues all permanent Student Pilot  Certificates on high quality plastic card stock containing tamper- and counterfeit-resistant  features.  15.2 Medical Requirements.

A person exercising the privileges of a Student Pilot Certificate while  seeking a sport pilot certificate in a light sport aircraft other than a glider or balloon must  have a either a medical certificate or U.S. driver’s license. Refer to § 61.23(c)(2) for  associated driver’s license considerations. Refer to § 61.23(c)(3) for student pilot  requirements when using “BasicMed” in lieu of a medical certificate, which are  applicable when operating under the conditions and limitations set forth in § 61.113(i).  For medical certificate requirements and duration, refer to § 61.23.  15.3 Temporary Student Pilot Certificate. An applicant may obtain a temporary Student  Pilot Certificate after being vetted by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).  This is done through the Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application  (IACRA) if the original application was made through IACRA or directly from the FAA  Airmen Certification Branch if a paper application was submitted. An applicant may  obtain a temporary Student Pilot Certificate from an ASI or AST as an emergency field  reissuance only.  15.4 Eligibility Requirements. Additional information on the eligibility requirements for  student pilots is in § 61.83, and the general limitations for student pilots are in § 61.89. If  an applicant has a known medical issue that would require a limitation on the applicant’s  Student Pilot Certificate, the applicant should contact the responsible FSDO to ensure the  application is processed with the correct limitations.  16 ACCEPTANCE OF A STUDENT PILOT APPLICATION. Authorized individuals  may accept a person’s application for an FAA Student Pilot Certificate by utilizing the  FAA’s IACRA or the paper FAA Form 8710-1.  16.1 IACRA. Authorized individuals are encouraged to utilize IACRA for the purpose of  accepting a student pilot application. IACRA is an Internet-based certification/rating  application system that guides the user through the FAA’s application process. Access  IACRA on the Internet at https://iacra.faa.gov/iacra/. The website also contains an  instruction manual for additional assistance. Using IACRA is a quicker and more  efficient process to obtain an airman certificate than using the paper FAA Form 8710-1.  16.2 Registration Process. In order for a CFI, DPE, ACR, ASI, or AST to accept a student  pilot application, the person must be registered in IACRA in the appropriate role. On the  IACRA website, click on the “Register” link within the “Login” window. On the next  screen, select the “Appropriate Role” under the “Instructors” heading. Follow the  onscreen prompts to complete the registration. Even though the instructor is a certifying  officer, his or her signature will be reflected in the “Instructor Action” section.  17 STUDENT PILOT CERTIFICATE ELIGIBILITY. In accordance with § 61.193(b),  before processing an application for a Student Pilot Certificate, the authorized individual  must ensure the applicant meets the eligibility requirements of § 61.83 and verify the  applicant’s identity.

If it is determined that the applicant does not meet  the FAA standard, process the application as follows:  1. When using IACRA, answer the questions concerning the FAA AELS. The  system will recognize if the applicant has or has not met the FAA AELS and  process the application as necessary. The applicant will not be required to  mail additional paperwork to the responsible FSDO.  2. When using a paper FAA Form 8710-1, check the “Rejected Student Pilot  Application” box in the appropriate section on the last page (e.g., “Instructor  Action” section or “Designated Examiner or Airman Certification  Representative Report” section). Also check the box “Referred to FSO for  Aviation English Language Standard Determination” in “Remarks” at the  bottom of the form. Only an ASI may check the box in the FAA AELS  statement at the bottom of the last page on the application, “Does Not Meet  FAA Aviation English Language Standard.” After verifying the application is  complete, forward this application to the responsible FSDO for data entry and  processing, even if the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements.  Find the address and contact information for the responsible FSDO at  http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/field_offices/fsdo/.  Note: If the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements of § 61.83,  DO NOT check the “Accepted Student Pilot Application” box. The “Accepted  Student Pilot Application” box should only be checked once it is determined the  applicant meets all eligibility requirements. Check the “Rejected Student Pilot  Application” box and continue processing the application. The terms “accepted”  and “rejected” are used to notify the Civil Aviation Registry that the applicant  meets, or may not meet, the requirements for the issuance of a Student Pilot  Certificate. If the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements for English  language or age, the application should still be processed and mailed to the  responsible FSDO or the Civil Aviation Registry, as appropriate.  18 STUDENT PILOT APPLICATION PROCESS: IACRA. A person who meets the  eligibility requirements of a Student Pilot Certificate may register as an applicant through  IACRA, which stores FAA Form 8710-1 electronically until an authorized individual  accesses the form. An authorized individual may access FAA Form 8710-1 by searching  for the person’s unique FAA tracking number (FTN) assigned by an FAA internal system  after the person has completed the required items on the student pilot application form.  The authorized individual will verify that the applicant meets the regulatory eligibility  requirements and that the application has been completed properly. Additionally, the  authorized individual will verify the applicant’s identity and input the applicant’s photo  identification data into IACRA when prompted, according to paragraph 11. Once the  authorized individual has completed the application through IACRA, it will be  transmitted electronically to the Civil Aviation Registry for processing. The student pilot  applicant can expect the pilot certificate to arrive via the United States Postal Service  (USPS) approximately 5 weeks from the date of application submission.'},\n",

Find the address and contact information for the responsible  FSDO at http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/field_offices/fsdo/. Once the data is  captured, the FSDO will mail the application file to the Civil Aviation Registry via  first-class mail to the following address: Federal Aviation Administration, Airmen  Certification Branch (AFB-720), P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK 73125. The FAA  notes that the submittal of a paper FAA Form 8710-1 may delay the issuance of a Student  Pilot Certificate because of mailing time to the Civil Aviation Registry. Once the Civil  Aviation Registry receives the student pilot application, the student pilot applicant can  expect the pilot certificate to arrive via the USPS approximately 5 weeks from the date of  application submission.  19.3 Documentation of Identification. CFIs accepting a person’s application for a Student  Pilot Certificate should review the person’s photograph identification presented at the  time of application to confirm it is current and valid. The flight instructor should  document the type of identification and number submitted (e.g., Virginia driver’s license  number A12345678 and expiration date xx/xx/xxxx) on the FAA Form 8710-1  “Airman’s Identification (ID)” section in accordance with the guidelines provided earlier.  20 PRE-SOLO REQUIREMENTS AND PRIVILEGES.  20.1 Student Pilot Certificate. A current paper Student Pilot Certificate will remain valid  until its expiration date or when superseded with another airman certificate. A new  Student Pilot Certificate issued on a plastic card does not have an expiration date.  However, some of the endorsements that authorize and limit a student pilot’s privileges  are valid for 90 calendar-days from the date of endorsement. Regardless of the Student  Pilot Certificate being paper or plastic, these endorsements are required to be issued in  the student pilot’s logbook to exercise solo privileges, unless the student pilot has  obtained a higher level pilot certificate. Per § 61.87(p), the authorized flight instructor  who gave the training to the student must give these endorsements.'},\n",

Presenting to an ASI, AST, or appropriate designee a record showing that,  within the preceding 12 calendar-months from the month of application, the  flight instructor passed an official U.S. Armed Forces military instructor pilot  proficiency check. Refer to § 61.197(a)(2)(iv).  5. Presenting to an ASI, AST, or appropriate designee a record showing that,  within the preceding 24 calendar-months, the flight instructor served as a  company check pilot, chief flight instructor, or flight instructor in a 14 CFR  part 121 or 135 operation, or in a position involving the regular evaluation of  pilots (§ 61.197(a)(2)(ii)). Order 8900.1, Volume 5, Chapter 2, Section 11,  Conduct a Title 14 CFR Part 61 Flight Instructor  Initial/Reinstatement/Renewal Certification and Additional Category/Class  Ratings, subparagraph 5-504C, Section 61.197(a)(2)(ii), provides the  following examples of “a position involving the regular evaluation of pilots:”  • A PIC of a multiple pilot flightcrew aircraft under part 121 or 135,  • Corporate PICs of a multiple pilot flightcrew aircraft under 14 CFR part 125  or 133,  • U.S. military pilots who are PICs of a multiple pilot flightcrew aircraft,  • U.S. military instructor pilots and examiners who regularly evaluate pilots, and  • Flight instructors who actively instruct in part 61 schools.  Note: FAA ASIs should review evidence of the applicant’s employment, which  should clearly show that the applicant is in a position involving the regular  evaluation of pilots. ASIs also should have personal knowledge of the applicant’s  flight instructing capabilities and qualities before renewing that applicant’s flight  instructor certificate.  6. Submitting an application for renewal by mail. The procedure is described in  Order 8900.1, Volume 5, Chapter 2, Section 11, Subparagraph 5-504D,  Procedures for Processing a Flight Instructor Certification Renewal Via  U.S. Mail. Information on the notary service required when applying by mail  may be found at the U.S. Department of State (DOS) website at  https://travel.state.gov.  30.2 Length of Renewal. Provided that the certificate is renewed within 3 calendar-months  before the expiration month of a current flight instructor certificate, the renewed  certificate will be valid for an additional 24 calendar-months beyond the expiration date  shown on the current certificate.  Example 1: If a flight instructor renewal applicant’s current flight instructor  certificate expires in August, then that applicant must accomplish one of the flight  instructor renewal actions in the months of May, June, July, or August or make  application to retain the month of August as the expiration month per  § 61.197(b)(2)(i).'},\n",

       "  'text': '8/27/18    AC 61-65H  24  Example 2: Assume a flight instructor renewal applicant has August 31, 20xx,  showing on the applicant’s current flight instructor certificate. The applicant  completes a FIRC on June 1, 20xx, and presents his or her current flight instructor  certificate, FIRC graduation certificate, and completed FAA Form 8710-1 to a  FSDO on June 1, 20xx. The flight instructor certificate is renewed with a new  expiration date of August 31, 20x2 (per § 61.197(b)(2)(ii)). The month in which  the flight instructor certificate expires is unchanged if the renewal applicant  completes the requirement(s) for renewal within the 3 calendar-months prior to  the month of expiration.  30.2.1 Renewal Outside of the 3 Calendar-Month Period. If the flight instructor certification  renewal action occurs outside the 3 calendar-month period of the expiration month on the  flight instructor certificate, the renewed flight instructor certificate will be valid for  24 calendar-months from the month the renewal requirements of § 61.197 were  accomplished. The applicant must present a FIRC graduation certificate to a FSDO  within 3 calendar-months of completion of the FIRC. The renewal action of § 61.197(a)  must be accomplished before the expiration date shown on the applicant’s flight  instructor certificate. If the applicant completes a FIRC more than 3 calendar-months  prior to the expiration month of the current flight instructor certificate, the expiration date  will be 24 calendar-months after the month the FAA Form 8710-1 application is  submitted to the FAA, provided the application is submitted within 3 calendar-months of  completion of the FIRC.  30.2.2 Determining the Expiration Date. The following examples help explain how to determine  the date from which the 24 calendar-month renewal flight instructor certificate should be  dated.  Example 1: The flight instructor completes the FIRC within the  3 calendar-months preceding the expiration date of the current certificate  and files an FAA Form 8710-1 application to renew the certificate within  3 calendar-months of the date of graduation from the FIRC. In this example, the  CFI would get a new certificate with a new expiration date of 24 calendar-months  from the date of expiration of his current certificate, as prescribed in  § 61.197(b)(2)(ii).  Example 2: The flight instructor has a certificate with an expiration date of  August 31, 20xx. The FIRC is completed on January 5, 20xx, 7 calendar-months  before the expiration date of the current certificate. The flight instructor applies  for renewal of the certificate on April 13, 20xx, within 3 calendar-months of the  date of the FIRC graduation. The flight instructor would receive a new certificate  with an expiration date of 24 calendar-months from April 30, 20xx, or in other  words, April 30, 20x2.  Example 3: The flight instructor has a certificate with an expiration date of  August 31, 20xx. The flight instructor completes the FIRC on March 7, 20xx,  and applies for renewal of the certificate on June 2, 20xx. This is within  3 calendar-months of the date of the FIRC graduation and within'},\n",

In this case,  the flight instructor would receive a new certificate with an expiration date of  24 calendar-months from the date of application, or in other words, an expiration  date of June 30, 20x2. This is because, even though the application is dated within  3 calendar-months preceding the date of expiration of his or her current  certificate, the FIRC was not completed within the 3 calendar-months preceding  the date of expiration of his or her certificate, as required by § 61.197(b)(2)(ii).  Note: If you wish to retain the month of expiration of your flight instructor  certificate, it is recommended that you complete the renewal requirements and  submit your renewal application within the 3 calendar-months prior to the month  of expiration of your certificate.  30.3 Acceptable Documentation. There have been several inquiries asking about the intent of  the phrase, “or other documentation acceptable to the Administrator,” in § 61.3(d).  During the flight instructor certification renewal process, when a FIRC graduation  certificate is used for renewal and the applicant’s flight instructor certificate is being  processed for renewal, a copy of the FIRC graduation certificate is considered  “documentation acceptable to the Administrator” until the applicant receives his or her  permanent flight instructor certificate. Another example of other “documentation  acceptable to the Administrator” is a copy of the flight instructor renewal application,  FAA Form 8710-1, that the applicant completed and signed.  30.4 Requiring a Practical Test. Regardless of what has been explained in the paragraphs  above, it should be understood that the FAA has the prerogative to require any applicant  to complete a part or the entire applicable flight instructor practical test. A practical test  may be required if there is reason to believe that it will correct some deficiency in the  applicant’s instructing abilities or it has been determined necessary to introduce new  training procedures or certification requirements.  31 EXPIRED FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR CERTIFICATE. The requirements for holders of  an expired flight instructor certificate to obtain a new certificate are located in § 61.199.  A practical test is required to reinstate an expired flight instructor certificate. A DPE or  an ASI will not reinstate expired flight instructor certificates unless the applicant passes a  practical test or the applicant meets the requirements of SFAR 100-2 or § 61.199(a)(3).  1. The holder of an expired flight instructor certificate (i.e., a flight instructor  certificate that conforms to § 61.5(c)) may exchange that certificate for a new  certificate (except for a flight instructor certificate with a sport pilot rating) by  passing one practical test, per § 61.183(h), for one of the aircraft ratings held  on that person’s expired flight instructor certificate or by passing a flight  instructor practical test for an additional rating. If the practical test is for a  flight instructor certificate with a sport pilot rating, the examiner may only  issue that rating and provide endorsements for the category and class  privileges tested.'},\n",

To reinstate instructor privileges, the applicant must meet  all requirements for initial issuance of a flight instructor certificate.  3. Relief is available for persons supporting U.S. Armed Forces operations (refer  to SFAR 100-2). FSDOs are authorized to accept an expired flight instructor  certificate to show eligibility under § 61.197 for renewal of a flight instructor  certificate from an eligible person who meets the requirements of  SFAR 100-2. The eligible person must present the FSDO with the required  documents along with FAA Form 8710-1.  4. Military instructors can reinstate an expired flight instructor certificate if, at  the time of application, they can provide a record showing that, within the  preceding 6 calendar-months from the date of application for reinstatement,  the person has passed a U.S. Armed Forces instructor pilot or pilot examiner  proficiency check or completed a U.S. Armed Forces instructor pilot or pilot  examiner training course and received an additional aircraft rating  qualification as a military instructor pilot or pilot examiner that is appropriate  to the flight instructor rating sought (§ 61.199(a)(3)).  32 INSTRUMENT RATING. Section 61.65 contains specific aeronautical knowledge,  flight proficiency, aeronautical experience, and endorsement requirements for the  instrument rating.  33 ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT RATINGS (OTHER THAN ATP). Specific aeronautical  knowledge, flight proficiency, and endorsement requirements for additional category,  class, or type rating (for ratings other than at the ATP level) are located in § 61.63.  33.1 Category and Class Ratings. Applicants adding a category and/or class rating to a  recreational pilot certificate or higher, other than ATP, must have instructor  recommendations and appropriate endorsements. An applicant for other than an ATP  Certificate with airplane category multiengine class rating need not take an additional  knowledge test, provided the person holds an airplane, powered-lift, rotorcraft, PPC,  weight-shift-control aircraft, or airship rating at or above the pilot certificate level sought.  An applicant must pass the required practical test appropriate to the pilot certificate for  the aircraft category and, if applicable, class rating sought. Additionally, applicants must  comply with the requirements of § 61.63, as noted below:  33.1.1 Category Ratings. Applicants must receive the training and have the aeronautical  experience required by part 61 that applies to the pilot certificate level for the category,  and if applicable, class rating sought.  33.1.2 Class Ratings. Applicants must be found competent in the knowledge areas and proficient  in the Areas of Operation for the class rating sought.  33.1.3 Type Ratings. Applicants must have the required training, logbook, or training record  endorsements, and pass the required practical test in accordance with the ATP/type rating  ACS or PTS, as appropriate.

An applicant holding at least a recreational pilot certificate may apply for the  issuance of a category and class rating limited to a specific make and model of  experimental aircraft in accordance with the provisions of § 61.63(h), with the limitation  “Authorized Experimental Aircraft: [Category] and [Class] rating [Make] and [Model].”  The applicant is required to receive a logbook endorsement from an authorized flight  instructor who has determined that the applicant is proficient to act as PIC of the same  category, class, and make and model of experimental aircraft for which the application  was made. The 5 hours of flight experience must have been logged between  September 1, 2004, and August 31, 2005. Once the pilot complies with the provisions of  § 61.63(h), that pilot may be issued the appropriate category and class rating limited to a  specific make and model of experimental aircraft.  33.3 Tailwheel Endorsement. Section 61.31(i) prescribes additional training required for  operating tailwheel airplanes. Some tailwheel airplanes have different configurations  such as wheels, floats, or skis. If a pilot is going to act as PIC of an aircraft configured  (equipped) with main wheels and a tailwheel, the pilot must have the training and  endorsement. If the aircraft has skis or floats in place of the wheeled landing gear, the  training cannot be accomplished and thus the endorsement is not required. The training  and endorsement required by the regulation must be done when the aircraft has a  tailwheel in the wheeled landing gear configuration. Refer to § 61.31(i)(2) for an  exception to the training and endorsement requirement.  34 ADDITIONAL CATEGORY/CLASS RATINGS AT THE ATP CERTIFICATION  LEVEL.  34.1 Specific requirements for additional category, class, or type rating (at the ATP  certification level) are located in § 61.165.  34.2 An instructor recommendation is not required, unless the applicant has failed the practical  test and this is a retest (per § 61.49). Applicants for retest must comply with the  appropriate retest requirements of § 61.49. In addition, the instructor must sign the  applicant’s FAA Form 8710-1 application for the retest. If seeking to add airplane  category and multiengine class rating to an ATP Certificate, the applicant must complete  an approved ATP CTP in accordance with § 61.156 prior to taking the required  knowledge test.  34.3 An applicant holding an ATP Certificate may apply for the issuance of an appropriate  type rating if one has been established, and experimental aircraft authorization, by make  and model, on the applicant’s pilot certificate, or a temporary letter of authorization  (LOA) issued by the Flight Standards Operations inspector, as appropriate. The applicant  may complete the appropriate aircraft type rating practical test in the subject aircraft. An  applicant may also qualify for an additional aircraft category and class rating on his or  her pilot certificate for an aircraft issued an experimental certificate in accordance with  the provisions of § 61.165(g). If the applicant is unable to meet the requirements of  § 61.165(g), the applicant may apply in accordance with § 61.165(a)–(f), as applicable.'},\n",

A person who holds a flight instructor certificate issued under part 61 and is in  compliance with § 61.197 when conducting ground training or flight training  in accordance with the privileges and limitations of his or her flight instructor  certificate; or  3. A person authorized by the Administrator to provide ground training or flight  training under part 61, 121, 135, or 142 when conducting ground training or  flight training in accordance with that authority.  38 ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR GLIDERS. Specific training and authorization  requirements for ground-tow, aerotow, and self-launch procedures for gliders are located  in § 61.31(j).  38.1 Ground-Tow Procedures. Pilots who desire to act as PIC of a glider using ground-tow  procedures must have satisfactorily accomplished ground and flight training on  ground-tow procedures and operations. The pilot must have received an endorsement  from an authorized instructor who certifies in that pilot’s logbook that the pilot has been  found proficient in ground-tow procedures and operations. Refer to § 61.31(j)(1)(i).  38.2 Aerotow Procedures. Pilots who desire to act as PIC of a glider using aerotow  procedures must have satisfactorily accomplished ground and flight training on aerotow  procedures and operations. The pilot must have received an endorsement from an  authorized instructor who certifies in that pilot’s logbook that the pilot has been found  proficient in aerotow procedures and operations.

Prior to  September 1, 2004, some weight-shift-control aircraft had been issued an experimental  certificate in the glider category. In these cases only, initial pilot certification for the  issuance of at least a private pilot certificate with a glider rating limited to  weight-shift-control or glider-trike privileges was authorized. After September 1, 2004,  issuance of at least a private pilot certificate with a glider rating limited to  weight-shift-control or glider-trike privileges is no longer authorized, nor necessary, now  that there are established training and certification requirements for weight-shift-control  category aircraft under part 61.  38.6 Weight-Shift-Control Aircraft Certification after January 15, 2005. Effective  January 15, 2005, airmen who conducted their initial pilot certification in a  weight-shift-control aircraft that was certificated as an experimental aircraft in the glider  category and received a private pilot certificate or higher with a glider rating limited to  weight-shift-control or glider-trike privileges can apply using FAA Form 8710-11 at a  FSDO for a weight-shift-control category and/or class rating to be added to their airman  certificate with no further showing of competency.  39 ENHANCED FLIGHT VISION SYSTEM (EFVS). There are two types of EFVS  operations: EFVS operations to 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation (TDZE)  and EFVS operations to touchdown and rollout. An EFVS is an installed aircraft system  which uses an electronic means to provide a display of the forward external scene  topography (the natural or manmade features of a place or region, especially in a way to  show their relative positions and elevation) through the use of imaging sensors, including  but not limited to forward-looking infrared, millimeter wave radiometry, millimeter wave  radar, or low-light level image intensification. An EFVS includes the display element,  sensors, computers and power supplies, indications, and controls. EFVS operations to  100 feet above the TDZE were enabled through 69 FR 1619, Enhanced Flight Vision  Systems, published in 2004. In 2016, the FAA amended the EFVS regulations to also  permit EFVS operations to touchdown and rollout. Additionally, 81 FR 90126, Revisions  to Operational Requirements for the Use of Enhanced Flight Vision Systems (EFVS) and  to Pilot Compartment View Requirements for Vision Systems, published in 2016,  established minimum ground and flight training requirements for pilots conducting EFVS  operations. The operating requirements for EFVS operations can be found in 14 CFR  part 91, § 91.176, and the minimum ground and flight training requirements for EFVS  operations can be found in § 61.66. Operational and training guidance for EFVS  operations can be found in AC 90-106, Enhanced Flight Vision Systems. Recommended  endorsements for the training are contained in Appendix A, Sample Endorsements.  40 AC FEEDBACK FORM. For your convenience, the AC Feedback Form is the last page  of this AC.

Under § 61.56(g), a  certificated pilot is not considered a student pilot when seeking solo privileges in a  category/class aircraft in which the pilot is not already certificated.  20.7 Endorsement for Each Solo Cross-Country. In addition to the endorsements required  by § 61.93(c)(1) and (2), for each solo cross-country flight, a student pilot must have an  endorsement from an instructor after the instructor reviews the student’s cross-country  planning. That endorsement must comply with § 61.93(c)(3). An authorized instructor  may not permit a student pilot to conduct a solo cross-country flight unless the instructor  has complied with § 61.93(d)(1)–(5). This endorsement does not need to be made by the  instructor who normally provides training to the student. However, the flight instructor  must ensure that all other required endorsements have been previously provided, such as  the endorsement required by § 61.93(c)(1) and (2) for conducting solo cross-country  flights.  20.8 Takeoffs and Landings at an Airport Within 25 Nautical Miles (NM). A flight  instructor may authorize a student to practice solo takeoffs and landings at an airport  within 25 NM (or 15 NM in the case of a Powered Parachute (PPC)) from the airport at  which the student pilot normally receives training after meeting the requirements of  § 61.93(b)(1).  20.9 Repeated Solo Cross-Country Flights. A student pilot may be authorized to make  repeated, specific solo cross-country flights that are not greater than 50 NM from the  point of departure if the student meets the requirements of § 61.93(b)(2). The authorized  instructor should specify in the student’s logbook endorsement the conditions under  which the flights may be made.  20.10 Class B, C, and D Airspace. A student pilot who seeks a sport pilot certificate or a  recreational pilot certificate and wants to obtain privileges to operate in Class B, C, and D  airspace, at an airport located in Class B, C, or D airspace, and to, from, through, or at an  airport having an operational control tower, must receive and log ground and flight  training from an authorized instructor on the aeronautical knowledge areas listed in  § 61.94(a) and have received a logbook endorsement in accordance with § 61.94(b). The  ground and flight training for the specific Class B, C, or D airspace must be within the  90 calendar-day period preceding the date of the flight in that airspace. The ground and  flight training for the specific airport located in Class B, C, or D airspace must be within  the 90 calendar-day period preceding the date of the flight at that airport.  20.11 Solo Flight in Class B Airspace. A student pilot may not operate an aircraft on a solo  flight in Class B airspace unless the student pilot has received both ground and flight  training from an authorized instructor on the Class B airspace area, and received the  training in the specific Class B airspace area for which solo flight is authorized. The  authorized instructor who gave the student pilot flight training has endorsed the logbook  of that student pilot, the endorsement is dated within the 90 calendar-day period  preceding the date of the flight in that Class B airspace area, and the logbook  endorsement specifies that the student pilot has received the required ground and flight',\n",

With certain limitations, a DPE or an FAA ASI may conduct  the practical test for a sport pilot certificate in an LSA having a single seat. Refer to  § 61.45(f) for specific provisions. The examiner must agree to conduct the test  (§ 61.45(f)(1)) and must conduct the practical test in accordance with the sport pilot PTS  or ACS, as appropriate. Knowledge of all tasks applicable to their category/class of  aircraft will be evaluated orally. The examiner must be in a position to observe the  operation of the aircraft while evaluating the proficiency of the applicant (§ 61.45(f)(2)).  13.3 Single-Seat Limitation. The limitation, “No passenger carriage and flight in a single-seat  light-sport aircraft only,” will be placed on the person’s pilot certificate per § 61.45(f)(3).  Only a DPE or an ASI is authorized to remove this limitation. The DPE or ASI can  accomplish this when the sport pilot takes a practical test in a two-place LSA and  conducts the additional tasks identified in the ACS or PTS, as appropriate. This practical  test may be conducted in the same or additional category of aircraft. Upon successful  completion of the practical test, the DPE or ASI will remove the limitation and the sport  pilot is authorized to act as pilot in command (PIC) in all categories of LSA for which the  sport pilot has an endorsement. The DPE or ASI can also remove the limitation if the  sport pilot completes the certification requirements in an aircraft with a minimum of  two places for a higher certificate or rating.  13.4 Flight Review. A sport pilot whose certificate has a single-seat limitation must complete  a flight review, as required by § 61.56. The flight review must be in an aircraft with a  minimum of two pilot stations, in which the pilot is rated, and with an authorized  instructor who is current and qualified to act as PIC.  13.5 Additional Category or Class. An instructor may perform a proficiency check for an  additional category or class in accordance with §§ 61.45(f) and 61.321 to be added to a  sport pilot certificate or higher using a single-seat LSA, provided the instructor is also a  DPE or an ASI. The instructor or ASI must agree to conduct the proficiency check in a  single-seat LSA, and must ensure that the proficiency check is conducted in accordance  with the sport pilot PTS or ACS, as appropriate, for single-seat aircraft. The instructor  will evaluate knowledge of all tasks applicable to the category or class of aircraft orally.  Those pilots seeking sport pilot privileges in a single-seat LSA must demonstrate  competency in those specific tasks identified in the appropriate ACS or PTS and any  other tasks selected by the instructor. On successful completion of the proficiency check,  the instructor or ASI will issue an endorsement with the following limitation: “No  passenger carriage and flight in a single-pilot station aircraft only (add category/class),”  limiting the pilot’s operations to a single-seat aircraft in this category and class. The  instructor must sign this endorsement with his or her flight instructor and examiner  number.  13.6 Remove Limitation. This limitation can be removed once the pilot has successfully  completed a proficiency check involving the additional tasks identified in the appropriate  ACS or PTS in a two-pilot station LSA for the specific category and class rating sought  and in accordance with § 61.321. The proficiency check must be conducted in the same  category and class of LSA. Upon successful completion of the proficiency check, the  pilot will be issued an endorsement for the LSA privilege sought.',\n",

Refer to  § 61.327(a).  • If you hold a sport pilot certificate and you seek to operate an LSA that has a VH  greater than 87 KCAS. Refer to § 61.327(b).  6. Any pilot exercising sport pilot privileges in an aircraft for which the pilot  does not hold category or class privileges on a higher level pilot certificate,  does not hold the appropriate medical certificate, or is seeking sport pilot  privileges, must understand and comply with all sport pilot privileges and  limitations, particularly the applicable operating limits and endorsement  requirements in part 61 subpart J. Section 61.303 establishes which operating  limits and endorsement requirements apply to the operation of an LSA,  depending on the type of certificate or rating a pilot holds and the medical  eligibility requirements the pilot meets. For example, a pilot holds a  recreational pilot certificate, but not a medical certificate, and wishes to  exercise sport pilot privileges. The pilot must comply with cross-country  requirements in § 61.101(c), even if the flight does not exceed 50 NM from  the departure airport. Refer to § 61.303. The pilot must also comply with the  additional training requirements and endorsements established in item 3  above.  7. Each pilot exercising sport pilot privileges must carry his or her logbook and  other evidence of the required endorsements from an authorized instructor on  each flight. Other evidence of the required endorsements from an authorized  instructor may be a preprinted card or record that includes the endorsements.  Refer to § 61.51(i)(3).  8. A recreational pilot or higher, when exercising sport pilot privileges, is  required to have an endorsement for only the category and/or class of LSA for  which he or she is not authorized to act as PIC. A sport pilot is required to  have an endorsement for the category and class aircraft in which he or she is  authorized to act as PIC.  22 RECREATIONAL PILOT CERTIFICATION. Specific aeronautical knowledge,  flight proficiency, aeronautical experience, and endorsement requirements for the  recreational pilot certificate are located in part 61 subpart D.  1. Section 61.101 contains all limitations that pertain to the recreational pilot  certificate and outlines procedures for obtaining additional certificates or  ratings. An authorized flight instructor must supervise the training and  experience required in furtherance of a higher level of certificate. Each flight  conducted by the recreational pilot under those provisions must be authorized  by the flight instructor’s endorsement in the recreational pilot’s logbook.  2. Recreational pilots may act as PIC on a flight that is in Class B, C, and D  airspace, at an airport located in Class B, C, or D airspace, and to, from,  through, or at an airport having an operational control tower after having  received the required training and endorsement in accordance with',\n",
