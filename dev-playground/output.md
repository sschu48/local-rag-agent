**1** **PURPOSE OF THIS ADVISORY CIRCULAR (AC).** This AC provides guidance for
pilot and instructor applicants, pilots, flight instructors, ground instructors, and examiners
on certification standards, knowledge test procedures, and other requirements in Title 14
of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part [61](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=dbefbaa41e3aa85833650f1d6095d35f&mc=true&node=pt14.2.61&rgn=div5) .

**2** **AUDIENCE.** The primary audience for this AC is all flight instructors, ground
instructors, and Designated Pilot Examiners (DPE). It includes applicants for pilot
certificates, flight instructor certificates, and ground instructor certificates. The audience
also includes aviation safety inspectors (ASI) and aviation safety technicians (AST) who
conduct certification functions for pilots and/or have oversight of a designee who
performs pilot or instructor certifications. The secondary audience includes Flight
Standards Service offices. Title 14 CFR Part [107](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=dbefbaa41e3aa85833650f1d6095d35f&mc=true&node=pt14.2.107&rgn=div5) , Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems,
operators should refer to AC [107-2](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1019962) , Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS), for
certificate requirements.

**3** **SAFETY MESSAGE.** Safety is the number one goal of all airmen and instructors. This
AC is an aviation safety resource that helps avoid risk. Endorsements represent training
requirements completed and privileges granted. This AC helps airmen and instructors
ensure that all training is completed and documented clearly and concisely. An
endorsement marks and formalizes events such as an operating privilege or authorization
granted or a limitation incurred. Applying the recommended endorsements reduces the
risk that someone will act without a prerequisite or will misunderstand a limitation.

**4** **WHERE YOU CAN FIND THIS AC.** You can find this AC on the Federal Aviation
Administration’s (FAA) website at [http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_cir](http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars)

**7** **SUMMARY OF CHANGES.** See Appendix B , Summary of Changes, for changes from

this AC’s previous edition.

**8** **PILOT TRAINING AND TESTING.** Part 61 contains eligibility, aeronautical
knowledge, flight proficiency, and aeronautical experience requirements for each pilot
certificate, instrument rating, flight instructor certificate, and ground instructor certificate.
The Areas of Operation specified for each certificate by part 61 encompass the Areas of
Operation and tasks contained in the ACS or PTS, as appropriate. Instructors must train
applicants “...to acceptable standards in all subject matter areas, procedures, and
maneuvers included in the tasks within the appropriate practical test standard.”

**9** **KNOWLEDGE TESTS.** Airman knowledge tests cover the aeronautical knowledge
areas prescribed in part 61.


**9.1** **Knowledge Test Administration.** An applicant for a knowledge test must meet the

requirements detailed in part 61, § [61.35(a)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d352ca99d49d21a002848a45ff3fa4e6&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_135&rgn=div8) . For the location of computerized testing
centers, consult the list at http://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/.

**9.2** **Evidence of Completion.** Applicants are not required to show evidence of completed
training to take flight instructor, ground instructor, military competency, or foreign pilot
instrument knowledge tests unless they are applying to retake a test after failing that test
per § [61.49](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d352ca99d49d21a002848a45ff3fa4e6&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_149&rgn=div8) . A person who applies for the knowledge test for an Airline Transport Pilot
(ATP) Certificate with an airplane category and multiengine class rating must present a
graduation certificate from an authorized training provider, as prescribed in § [61.156](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d352ca99d49d21a002848a45ff3fa4e6&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_1156&rgn=div8) .
Applicants for other ATP knowledge tests are not required to show evidence of
completed training unless they are applying to retake a test after failing that test.

**9.3** **Relief for Certain U.S. Military and Civilian Personnel.** Special rules, Special Federal
Aviation Regulations (SFAR) [100-2](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=90de921a6f27a5b2711c36dd48917a8e&node=ap14.2.61.2&rgn=div9) and § [61.199(a)(3)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d352ca99d49d21a002848a45ff3fa4e6&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_1199&rgn=div8) , grant relief to U.S. military and
civilian personnel who are assigned outside the United States in support of U.S. Armed
Forces operations. ASIs and ASTs are authorized to accept, from an eligible person, an
expired flight instructor certificate for renewal of that certificate or to obtain a new
instructor privilege on that certificate. ASIs and ASTs are also authorized to accept an
expired knowledge test report to show eligibility under part 61 to take a practical test.
The eligible person must present the ASI or AST with the required documents along with
FAA Form [8710-1](https://www.faa.gov/forms/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1031493) , Airman Certificate and/or Rating Application. Refer to SFAR 100-2
and §§ [61.197](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d352ca99d49d21a002848a45ff3fa4e6&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_1197&rgn=div8) and 61.199(a)(3).

**10** **COMPLETION OF GROUND TRAINING OR A HOME STUDY CURRICULUM.**

**10.1** **General.**

1. The FAA Airman Testing website contains detailed information about all
airman tests. Refer to [https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/](https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/) .


2. The AKT regulations are §§ 61.35 and [61.37](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d352ca99d49d21a002848a45ff3fa4e6&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_137&rgn=div8) . Refer to the FAA AKT website

at https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/media/testing_matrix.pdf.

**10.2** **Home Study Curriculum.** Except for applicants for an ATP Certificate with an airplane
category and multiengine class rating, applicants may obtain ground training for the
knowledge test from pilot schools, colleges, aviation organizations, and individual flight
or ground instructors. Home study curricula are available from representatives of the
aviation industry. Students may develop an individual home study curriculum compiled
from material described in the applicable FAA airman knowledge test guide. The student,
to show evidence of a ground school or home study curriculum completion, may use any
one of the following methods:

1. A certificate of graduation from a pilot training course conducted by an
FAA-certificated pilot school, appropriate to the certificate or rating sought, or
a statement of accomplishment from the school certifying satisfactory
completion of the ground school portion of the course.

2. An endorsement from an authorized instructor who has certified that the
applicant has satisfactorily completed the ground training required for the
certificate or rating sought and is prepared for the test.

3. A certificate of graduation or statement of accomplishment from a ground
school course, appropriate to the certificate and rating sought, that was
conducted by an agency such as a high school, college, adult education
program, the Civil Air Patrol (CAP), or a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
(ROTC) flight training program.

4. A certificate of graduation from an industry-provided aviation home study
course. The aeronautical enterprise providing the study material must develop
the certificate. The certificate of graduation must correspond to the FAA
knowledge test for the certificate or rating sought. The aeronautical enterprise
providing the course of study must also furnish a comprehensive knowledge
test, which the course provider can score as evidence that the student has
completed the course of study. The knowledge test must be sent to the course
provider for scoring. Upon satisfactory completion of the examination, a
graduation certificate signed by an authorized certificated flight instructor
(CFI) of the course provider will be provided to the student.

5. Applicants are encouraged to obtain ground training using one of the methods
described in items 1 through 4 above. An applicant who is unable to provide
any of the above documents may present an individually developed home
study course to an appropriately certificated flight or ground instructor. The
instructor will review the course materials and question the applicant to


-----

determine that the course was completed and that the applicant does possess
the knowledge required for the certificate or rating sought. The instructor will
then complete an endorsement certifying that the applicant is prepared for the
knowledge test.

**11** **VERIFICATION OF IDENTITY, AGE, AND ENGLISH LANGUAGE**
**STANDARD.** Applicants for knowledge tests and airman certificates must provide
positive proof of identification, address, age, and meet English language standards at the
time of application.

**11.1** **Identification.** Applicants must present unexpired, official government-issued
identification that contains the applicant’s photograph and the applicant’s signature.
The applicant may present this information in more than one form of identification.
Refer to the AKT website at https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/media/testing_
matrix.pdf for more information on acceptable identification.

**11.2** **Address.** A mailing address for delivery of the applicant’s certificate may be indicated on
FAA Form 8710-1 or FAA Form [8710-11](https://www.faa.gov/forms/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/185791) , Airman Certificate and/or Rating
Application – Sport Pilot, as appropriate. However, the residential address required for
official record purposes for a certificate must be provided to specify the airman’s actual
permanent residential street number, city, state, and ZIP code, including apartment
number, where appropriate. The airman can specify an address to be printed on the
permanent airman certificate, if different than the applicant’s current address. If the
applicant has a foreign address, the country must be stated. If a residential address does
not exist, the applicant must provide and attach to the application the geographic location
of his or her residence on a separate piece of paper and attest by signature. This can be in
the form of a map or written directions to the applicant’s physical residential address. An
applicant who resides on a boat must provide the boat dock number or vessel registration
number. If the applicant resides in a recreational vehicle (RV), the state in which the RV
is registered, the registration number, and the vehicle identification number (VIN) should
be included. The supporting paperwork is submitted as part of the applicant’s application.

**11.3** **Age.** Applicants applying for a Student Pilot Certificate, knowledge test, and practical
test must show they meet the minimum age requirement for the certificate sought. In the
case of an applicant under the age of 18 years, the applicant’s parent or guardian may
have to accompany the applicant and identify themselves in accordance with regular
application procedures. If the parent or guardian attests to the applicant’s identity, the
parent or guardian’s photograph identification information should be placed on the
“Airman’s Identification (ID)” block of the “Attachments” section of FAA Form 8710-1,
and a remark added indicating the parent’s identification was used if the applicant is
applying for a Student Pilot Certificate. When applying to take a knowledge test,
applicants must show that they will meet the minimum age requirement for the certificate
sought within 24 calendar-months of the date of application for the knowledge test, with
the exception of those pilots applying for the ATP multiengine airplane knowledge test.
However, in accordance with § 61.35(a)(3), an applicant for the ATP multiengine
airplane knowledge test must be at least 18 years of age.


-----

**11.4** **English Language Standards.**


**11.4.1** General. To be eligible for an FAA pilot certificate, flight instructor certificate, or ground

instructor certificate or additional rating, an applicant must be able to read, write, speak,
and understand the English language, as stated in 14 CFR for the certificate sought.
Training facilities and individuals authorized to conduct evaluations, training, testing,
checking, or certification activities all share the responsibility to ensure that all applicants
for an FAA certificate or individuals who hold FAA certificates continually demonstrate
that they meet the FAA regulatory English language eligibility requirements. If there is a
question that the applicant or certificated individual may not meet the FAA regulatory
English language eligibility requirements to obtain or hold an FAA certificate, refer to
AC 60-28 and FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 5, Chapter 14, FAA English Language
Standard for Certification Under 14 CFR Parts 61, 63, 65, and 107, for guidance.


**11.4.2** Flight Review or Instrument Proficiency Check (IPC). If the pilot does not meet the FAA

Aviation English Language Standard (AELS) during a flight review or IPC, do not
endorse the pilot’s logbook or training record as complete. Provide a logbook entry for
the training received, advise the pilot, and contact the responsible Flight Standards
District Office (FSDO).


**11.4.3** Student Pilot. Before accepting an application for certification, to include processing an

application for a Student Pilot Certificate or issuing an endorsement for solo operations
or a practical test, the applicant must be evaluated in accordance with the guidelines
contained in AC 60-28, Appendix A, FAA English Language Standard Evaluation.


**11.4.4** Evaluators. AELS evaluators should develop multiple plans of action, as described

in AC 60-28, to conduct an FAA AELS evaluation. This will ensure that their evaluation
does not become predictable. Also, AELS evaluators must access the following
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) language proficiency website
that provides audio of the various ICAO English language levels in order to
familiarize themselves with the ICAO English Language Proficiency (ELP) operational
levels so they can best accomplish the FAA AELS evaluation: [http://cfapp.icao.int/rssta/](http://cfapp.icao.int/rssta/RSSTA.cfm)
[RSSTA.cfm](http://cfapp.icao.int/rssta/RSSTA.cfm) .

**12** **PRACTICAL TESTS.**

**12.1** **General.** A practical test is conducted to evaluate the applicant’s knowledge, skill, and
management of risk for the pilot certificate and rating sought. During a practical test, the
examiner will evaluate the applicant based on oral examination and observation of
performance-based skills in accordance with the appropriate ACS or PTS. However, the
examiner may use oral testing at any time during the practical test. An examiner is
responsible for determining whether the applicant meets the standards outlined in the
objective of each required task evaluated in accordance with the appropriate ACS or PTS.
Refer to the appropriate ACS or PTS for more information.


-----

**12.2** **PTS Requirements.** The PTS requires testing through oral or written questions and by
demonstrating piloting skills. Until these standards are replaced by the ACS, the PTS will
continue to be the standards document.

**12.3** **ACS Requirements.** For elements associated with tasks in the ACS, similar language is
used in the objective as stated above for the PTS; however, the ACS evaluates
knowledge, risk management, and skill elements for each task. Each element uses
language to clarify whether the evaluation will be accomplished through oral or
performance evaluation.

**12.4** **Use of Full Flight Simulators (FFS) and Flight Training Devices (FTD).** In
accordance with §§ [61.45(a)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=cf82cc617a434c6e62329b9fb4eb8613&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_145&rgn=div8) and [61.64](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=cf82cc617a434c6e62329b9fb4eb8613&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_164&rgn=div8) , an FFS or FTD may be used for some or all of
the practical test as authorized through an FAA-approved testing or checking program or
curriculum. Use of an Aviation Training Device (ATD) is not authorized on a practical
test for a certificate or rating or for an aircraft type rating. Additional information on the
use of an FFS, FTD, or ATD can be found in the appropriate ACS or PTS.

**12.5** **Two Calendar-Months or 60 Calendar-Days.** An applicant has two time limits that
apply to the certification practical test. What appears to be a conflict in the regulations
with reference to these time limits is not a conflict. Apply the time limits as written in the
regulations.



-  Time Limit 60 Calendar-Days. Section [61.43(f)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b5c78ce301f956ebb7e61b0363941f6f&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_143&rgn=div8) states that if a practical test is

discontinued, as defined in § 61.43(e), the applicant is entitled to credit for those
areas of operation that were passed, but only if the applicant complies with
§ 61.43(f)(1)–(4). The examiner or applicant may discontinue a practical test at any
time when the applicant fails one or more of the areas of operation or due to
inclement weather conditions, aircraft airworthiness, or any other safety-of-flight
concern. Section 61.43(f)(1) states that the applicant must pass “the remainder of the
practical test within the 60 calendar-day period after the date the practical test was
discontinued” to use that credit. After the 60 calendar-day period, credit no longer
applies and all areas of operation must be tested. A test may be discontinued for
failure of an area of operation or for safety of flight.



-  Time Limit 2 Calendar-Months. Section [61.39(f)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=1591c6e8551c6684d54f2bb87bcd6345&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_139&rgn=div8) states that all increments,

ground/oral and flight, of practical tests must be completed within 2 calendar-months.
The increment may be because the test was discontinued for reasons stated in
§ 61.43(e), or was planned to be conducted in increments. This is a separate time limit
from the 60 calendar-day limit prescribed above that applies to credit for tasks passed.

**13** **LIGHT-SPORT AIRCRAFT (LSA) WITH A SINGLE SEAT.**

**13.1** **General.** In accordance with § 61.45(f), a practical test may be conducted in an LSA that
has a single seat. The FAA believes that with certain limitations, it is appropriate to allow
the practical test for a sport pilot certificate only. This provision does not allow a
practical test for a flight instructor certificate or recreational pilot certificate or higher to
be conducted in an LSA that has a single pilot seat.


-----

**13.2** **Testing From the Ground.** With certain limitations, a DPE or an FAA ASI may conduct
the practical test for a sport pilot certificate in an LSA having a single seat. Refer to
§ 61.45(f) for specific provisions. The examiner must agree to conduct the test
(§ 61.45(f)(1)) and must conduct the practical test in accordance with the sport pilot PTS
or ACS, as appropriate. Knowledge of all tasks applicable to their category/class of
aircraft will be evaluated orally. The examiner must be in a position to observe the
operation of the aircraft while evaluating the proficiency of the applicant (§ 61.45(f)(2)).

**13.3** **Single-Seat Limitation.** The limitation, “No passenger carriage and flight in a single-seat
light-sport aircraft only,” will be placed on the person’s pilot certificate per § 61.45(f)(3).
Only a DPE or an ASI is authorized to remove this limitation. The DPE or ASI can
accomplish this when the sport pilot takes a practical test in a two-place LSA and
conducts the additional tasks identified in the ACS or PTS, as appropriate. This practical
test may be conducted in the same or additional category of aircraft. Upon successful
completion of the practical test, the DPE or ASI will remove the limitation and the sport
pilot is authorized to act as pilot in command (PIC) in all categories of LSA for which the
sport pilot has an endorsement. The DPE or ASI can also remove the limitation if the
sport pilot completes the certification requirements in an aircraft with a minimum of
two places for a higher certificate or rating.

**13.4** **Flight Review.** A sport pilot whose certificate has a single-seat limitation must complete
a flight review, as required by § [61.56](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=35fb14edff3efcaefda3e5fdf3a4fa64&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_156&rgn=div8) . The flight review must be in an aircraft with a
minimum of two pilot stations, in which the pilot is rated, and with an authorized
instructor who is current and qualified to act as PIC.

**13.5** **Additional Category or Class.** An instructor may perform a proficiency check for an
additional category or class in accordance with §§ 61.45(f) and [61.321](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=35fb14edff3efcaefda3e5fdf3a4fa64&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_1321&rgn=div8) to be added to a
sport pilot certificate or higher using a single-seat LSA, provided the instructor is also a
DPE or an ASI. The instructor or ASI must agree to conduct the proficiency check in a
single-seat LSA, and must ensure that the proficiency check is conducted in accordance
with the sport pilot PTS or ACS, as appropriate, for single-seat aircraft. The instructor
will evaluate knowledge of all tasks applicable to the category or class of aircraft orally.
Those pilots seeking sport pilot privileges in a single-seat LSA must demonstrate
competency in those specific tasks identified in the appropriate ACS or PTS and any
other tasks selected by the instructor. On successful completion of the proficiency check,
the instructor or ASI will issue an endorsement with the following limitation: “No
passenger carriage and flight in a single-pilot station aircraft only (add category/class),”
limiting the pilot’s operations to a single-seat aircraft in this category and class. The
instructor must sign this endorsement with his or her flight instructor and examiner
number.

**13.6** **Remove Limitation.** This limitation can be removed once the pilot has successfully
completed a proficiency check involving the additional tasks identified in the appropriate
ACS or PTS in a two-pilot station LSA for the specific category and class rating sought
and in accordance with § 61.321. The proficiency check must be conducted in the same
category and class of LSA. Upon successful completion of the proficiency check, the
pilot will be issued an endorsement for the LSA privilege sought.

practical test after being issued a Notice of Disapproval must present another
endorsement from their instructor in accordance with §§ 61.43(f) and 61.49(a)(2). The
endorsement must state that the applicant has received the necessary training and is
prepared for the practical test. An instructor’s recommendation on FAA Form 8710-1 is
required for each retest following a Notice of Disapproval conducted for a certificate or
rating. The applicant may receive credit for those Areas of Operation that the applicant
passed, but only if the applicant passes the remainder of the practical test within the
60 calendar-day period after the date the practical test was discontinued.

**14.3** **Testing Following a Letter of Discontinuance.** No additional endorsements are required
for an applicant to continue the practical test after being issued a Letter of
Discontinuance. The applicant is entitled to credit for those Areas of Operation that were
passed, but only if the applicant passes the remainder of the test within the
60 calendar-day period after the date the practical test was discontinued. If more than
60 calendar-days has passed, the applicant must accomplish the entire practical test.


**14.4** **Medical Certificate.** For detail on medical requirements, refer to 14 CFR parts 61, [67](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=91c3c2d5423f0507b4ca3b11064f5fd2&mc=true&node=pt14.2.67&rgn=div5) ,

experience, and endorsement requirements for the Student Pilot Certificate are located in
part 61 subpart [C](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=91c3c2d5423f0507b4ca3b11064f5fd2&mc=true&node=sp14.2.61.c&rgn=div6) .

**15.1** **Student Pilot Certification Application and Issuance.** A person may apply for a
Student Pilot Certificate with one of the following authorized individuals: a CFI, a DPE,
an FAA ASI or AST, or an Airman Certification Representative (ACR) associated with a
part 141 pilot school. The FAA Civil Aviation Registry issues all permanent Student Pilot
Certificates on high quality plastic card stock containing tamper- and counterfeit-resistant
features.

**15.2** **Medical Requirements.** Once a Student Pilot Certificate has been issued, the pilot must
comply with the applicable medical requirements in § [61.23](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=91c3c2d5423f0507b4ca3b11064f5fd2&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_123&rgn=div8) when exercising student
pilot privileges. A person is not required to hold a medical certificate when exercising the


-----

privileges of a Student Pilot Certificate while seeking a sport pilot certificate with glider
or balloon privileges or while seeking a pilot certificate with a glider rating or balloon
class rating. A person exercising the privileges of a Student Pilot Certificate while
seeking a sport pilot certificate in a light sport aircraft other than a glider or balloon must
have a either a medical certificate or U.S. driver’s license. Refer to § 61.23(c)(2) for
associated driver’s license considerations. Refer to § 61.23(c)(3) for student pilot
requirements when using “BasicMed” in lieu of a medical certificate, which are
applicable when operating under the conditions and limitations set forth in § [61.113(i)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=91c3c2d5423f0507b4ca3b11064f5fd2&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_1113&rgn=div8) .
For medical certificate requirements and duration, refer to § 61.23.

**15.3** **Temporary Student Pilot Certificate.** An applicant may obtain a temporary Student
Pilot Certificate after being vetted by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).
This is done through the Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application
(IACRA) if the original application was made through IACRA or directly from the FAA
Airmen Certification Branch if a paper application was submitted. An applicant may
obtain a temporary Student Pilot Certificate from an ASI or AST as an emergency field
reissuance only.

**15.4** **Eligibility Requirements.** Additional information on the eligibility requirements for
student pilots is in § [61.83](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=91c3c2d5423f0507b4ca3b11064f5fd2&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_183&rgn=div8) , and the general limitations for student pilots are in § [61.89](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=91c3c2d5423f0507b4ca3b11064f5fd2&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_189&rgn=div8) . If
an applicant has a known medical issue that would require a limitation on the applicant’s
Student Pilot Certificate, the applicant should contact the responsible FSDO to ensure the
application is processed with the correct limitations.

**16** **ACCEPTANCE OF A STUDENT PILOT APPLICATION.** Authorized individuals
may accept a person’s application for an FAA Student Pilot Certificate by utilizing the
FAA’s IACRA or the paper FAA Form 8710-1.

**16.1** **IACRA.** Authorized individuals are encouraged to utilize IACRA for the purpose of
accepting a student pilot application. IACRA is an Internet-based certification/rating
application system that guides the user through the FAA’s application process. Access
IACRA on the Internet at [https://iacra.faa.gov/iacra/](https://iacra.faa.gov/iacra/) . The website also contains an
instruction manual for additional assistance. Using IACRA is a quicker and more
efficient process to obtain an airman certificate than using the paper FAA Form 8710-1.

**16.2** **Registration Process.** In order for a CFI, DPE, ACR, ASI, or AST to accept a student
pilot application, the person must be registered in IACRA in the appropriate role. On the
IACRA website, click on the “Register” link within the “Login” window. On the next
screen, select the “Appropriate Role” under the “Instructors” heading. Follow the
onscreen prompts to complete the registration. Even though the instructor is a certifying
officer, his or her signature will be reflected in the “Instructor Action” section.


**17** **STUDENT PILOT CERTIFICATE ELIGIBILITY.** In accordance with § [61.193(b)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=91c3c2d5423f0507b4ca3b11064f5fd2&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_1193&rgn=div8) ,

before processing an application for a Student Pilot Certificate, the authorized individual
must ensure the applicant meets the eligibility requirements of § 61.83 and verify the
applicant’s identity. The authorized individual should use AC 60-28 and the ICAO
website to prepare for the assessment. AC 60-28 outlines the required procedures to


-----

ensure the applicant meets the FAA AELS. The ICAO website can be found at
http://cfapp.icao.int/rssta/RSSTA.cfm. If it is determined that the applicant does not meet
the FAA standard, process the application as follows:

1. When using IACRA, answer the questions concerning the FAA AELS. The
system will recognize if the applicant has or has not met the FAA AELS and
process the application as necessary. The applicant will not be required to
mail additional paperwork to the responsible FSDO.

2. When using a paper FAA Form 8710-1, check the “Rejected Student Pilot
Application” box in the appropriate section on the last page (e.g., “Instructor
Action” section or “Designated Examiner or Airman Certification
Representative Report” section). Also check the box “Referred to FSO for
Aviation English Language Standard Determination” in “Remarks” at the
bottom of the form. Only an ASI may check the box in the FAA AELS
statement at the bottom of the last page on the application, “Does Not Meet
FAA Aviation English Language Standard.” After verifying the application is
complete, forward this application to the responsible FSDO for data entry and
processing, even if the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements.
Find the address and contact information for the responsible FSDO at
[http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/field_offices/fsdo/](http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/field_offices/fsdo/) .

**Note:** If the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements of § 61.83,
DO NOT check the “Accepted Student Pilot Application” box. The “Accepted
Student Pilot Application” box should only be checked once it is determined the
applicant meets all eligibility requirements. Check the “Rejected Student Pilot
Application” box and continue processing the application. The terms “accepted”
and “rejected” are used to notify the Civil Aviation Registry that the applicant
meets, or may not meet, the requirements for the issuance of a Student Pilot
Certificate. If the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements for English
language or age, the application should still be processed and mailed to the
responsible FSDO or the Civil Aviation Registry, as appropriate.

**18** **STUDENT PILOT APPLICATION PROCESS: IACRA.** A person who meets the
eligibility requirements of a Student Pilot Certificate may register as an applicant through
IACRA, which stores FAA Form 8710-1 electronically until an authorized individual
accesses the form. An authorized individual may access FAA Form 8710-1 by searching
for the person’s unique FAA tracking number (FTN) assigned by an FAA internal system
after the person has completed the required items on the student pilot application form.
The authorized individual will verify that the applicant meets the regulatory eligibility
requirements and that the application has been completed properly. Additionally, the
authorized individual will verify the applicant’s identity and input the applicant’s photo
identification data into IACRA when prompted, according to paragraph 11 . Once the
authorized individual has completed the application through IACRA, it will be
transmitted electronically to the Civil Aviation Registry for processing. The student pilot
applicant can expect the pilot certificate to arrive via the United States Postal Service
(USPS) approximately 5 weeks from the date of application submission.


-----

**19** **STUDENT PILOT APPLICATION PROCESS: PAPER FAA FORM 8710-1.**
Applicants have the ability to apply for a Student Pilot Certificate in paper format on
FAA Form 8710-1 to ensure all applicants have the uninterrupted ability to apply for an
FAA Student Pilot Certificate.

**19.1** **Completion of FAA Form 8710-1.** Once the authorized individual verifies that the
applicant meets the eligibility requirements of § 61.83, he or she will check the
“Accepted Student Pilot Application” box in the appropriate section. The authorized
individual will also select the “Meets Aviation English Language Standard” box in the
FAA AELS statement at the bottom of the last page of the application. Once the
authorized individual has verified that the application was completed in accordance with
the form’s instructions and Order 8900.1, [Volume 5, Chapter 1, Section 3](http://fsims.faa.gov/WDocs/8900.1/V05%20Airman%20Cert/Chapter%2001/05_001_003Rev1.htm) , Phases of
Certification (available at [http://fsims.faa.gov/](http://fsims.faa.gov/) ), the authorized individual will send the
completed student pilot application to their responsible FSDO for data entry.

**19.2** **Contact Information.** Find the address and contact information for the responsible
FSDO at http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/field_offices/fsdo/. Once the data is
captured, the FSDO will mail the application file to the Civil Aviation Registry via
first-class mail to the following address: Federal Aviation Administration, Airmen
Certification Branch (AFB-720), P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK 73125. The FAA
notes that the submittal of a paper FAA Form 8710-1 may delay the issuance of a Student
Pilot Certificate because of mailing time to the Civil Aviation Registry. Once the Civil
Aviation Registry receives the student pilot application, the student pilot applicant can
expect the pilot certificate to arrive via the USPS approximately 5 weeks from the date of
application submission.

**19.3** **Documentation of Identification.** CFIs accepting a person’s application for a Student
Pilot Certificate should review the person’s photograph identification presented at the
time of application to confirm it is current and valid. The flight instructor should
document the type of identification and number submitted (e.g., Virginia driver’s license
number A12345678 and expiration date xx/xx/xxxx) on the FAA Form 8710-1
“Airman’s Identification (ID)” section in accordance with the guidelines provided earlier.

**20** **PRE-SOLO REQUIREMENTS AND PRIVILEGES.**

**20.1** **Student Pilot Certificate.** A current paper Student Pilot Certificate will remain valid
until its expiration date or when superseded with another airman certificate. A new
Student Pilot Certificate issued on a plastic card does not have an expiration date.
However, some of the endorsements that authorize and limit a student pilot’s privileges
are valid for 90 calendar-days from the date of endorsement. Regardless of the Student
Pilot Certificate being paper or plastic, these endorsements are required to be issued in
the student pilot’s logbook to exercise solo privileges, unless the student pilot has
obtained a higher level pilot certificate. Per § [61.87(p)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8e7caf7900b7c4a86a7a474d8d2af7a2&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_187&rgn=div8) , the authorized flight instructor
who gave the training to the student must give these endorsements.

sought, and the student must comply with any limitations included in the authorized
instructor’s endorsement. A student pilot must have the endorsements prescribed in
§ 61.93(c) for each cross-country flight.

**20.6** **Sport Pilot Privileges.** A certificated pilot seeking sport pilot privileges in an aircraft in
which the pilot does not hold category and class is required to complete a flight review in


-----

accordance with § 61.56 before conducting solo operations. Under § 61.56(g), a
certificated pilot is not considered a student pilot when seeking solo privileges in a
category/class aircraft in which the pilot is not already certificated.

**20.7** **Endorsement for Each Solo Cross-Country.** In addition to the endorsements required
by § 61.93(c)(1) and (2), for each solo cross-country flight, a student pilot must have an
endorsement from an instructor after the instructor reviews the student’s cross-country
planning. That endorsement must comply with § 61.93(c)(3). An authorized instructor
may not permit a student pilot to conduct a solo cross-country flight unless the instructor
has complied with § 61.93(d)(1)–(5). This endorsement does not need to be made by the
instructor who normally provides training to the student. However, the flight instructor
must ensure that all other required endorsements have been previously provided, such as
the endorsement required by § 61.93(c)(1) and (2) for conducting solo cross-country
flights.

**20.8** **Takeoffs and Landings at an Airport Within 25 Nautical Miles (NM).** A flight
instructor may authorize a student to practice solo takeoffs and landings at an airport
within 25 NM (or 15 NM in the case of a Powered Parachute (PPC)) from the airport at
which the student pilot normally receives training after meeting the requirements of
§ 61.93(b)(1).

**20.9** **Repeated Solo Cross-Country Flights.** A student pilot may be authorized to make
repeated, specific solo cross-country flights that are not greater than 50 NM from the

airplane or glider category ratings, the applicant must have received a logbook
endorsement that attests to satisfactory demonstration of instructional proficiency in stall
awareness, spin entry, spins, and spin recovery procedures in an airplane or glider, as
appropriate. This means, even if the applicant were to initially seek a flight instructor


-----

certificate with an airplane multiengine rating, the applicant would still be required to
receive a logbook endorsement that attests to satisfactory demonstration of instructional
proficiency in stall awareness, spin entry, spins, and spin recovery procedures. However,
the training would be required to be performed in an airplane, most likely a single-engine
land airplane, that is not restricted from spins.

**26.2** **Flight Instructor Certificate with Rotorcraft Category and Helicopter Class Rating.**
For applicants applying for a flight instructor certificate with rotorcraft category and
helicopter class rating, the applicant will be required to demonstrate touchdown
autorotations. An examiner may accept, at his or her discretion, a logbook endorsement in
lieu of demonstrating the touchdown portion of these tasks during the practical test. This
logbook endorsement must be given by a current flight instructor who meets the
requirements of § 61.195(h)(2) with a rotorcraft category and helicopter class rating on
his or her flight instructor certificate that provided the training and can attest to the
applicant’s competence in these tasks. The following areas must be trained and
documented in the endorsement, as evidence of instructional knowledge relating to the
elements, common errors, performance, and correction of common errors related to
straight-in and 180-degree autorotations. The examiner may accept this logbook
endorsement at the examiner’s discretion, provided the practical test is not a retest as a
result of the applicant failing the previous practical test for deficiencies in instructional
knowledge pertaining to the elements, common errors, performance, or correction of
common errors related to straight-in or 180-degree autorotations. In this scenario, the
examiner is not authorized to accept the endorsement outlined above. The applicant must
provide a helicopter appropriate for performing autorotations if demonstration of this task
is required during the retest.

6. Submitting an application for renewal by mail. The procedure is described in
Order 8900.1, Volume 5, Chapter 2, Section 11, Subparagraph 5-504D,
Procedures for Processing a Flight Instructor Certification Renewal Via
U.S. Mail. Information on the notary service required when applying by mail
may be found at the U.S. Department of State (DOS) website at
[https://travel.state.gov](https://travel.state.gov/) .

**30.2** **Length of Renewal.** Provided that the certificate is renewed within 3 calendar-months
before the expiration month of a current flight instructor certificate, the renewed
certificate will be valid for an additional 24 calendar-months beyond the expiration date
shown on the current certificate.

**Example 1:** If a flight instructor renewal applicant’s current flight instructor
certificate expires in August, then that applicant must accomplish one of the flight
instructor renewal actions in the months of May, June, July, or August or make
application to retain the month of August as the expiration month per
§ 61.197(b)(2)(i).


-----

**Example 2:** Assume a flight instructor renewal applicant has August 31, 20xx,
showing on the applicant’s current flight instructor certificate. The applicant
completes a FIRC on June 1, 20xx, and presents his or her current flight instructor
certificate, FIRC graduation certificate, and completed FAA Form 8710-1 to a
FSDO on June 1, 20xx. The flight instructor certificate is renewed with a new
expiration date of August 31, 20x2 (per § 61.197(b)(2)(ii)). The month in which
the flight instructor certificate expires is unchanged if the renewal applicant
completes the requirement(s) for renewal within the 3 calendar-months prior to
the month of expiration.


**30.2.1** Renewal Outside of the 3 Calendar-Month Period. If the flight instructor certification

renewal action occurs outside the 3 calendar-month period of the expiration month on the
flight instructor certificate, the renewed flight instructor certificate will be valid for
24 calendar-months from the month the renewal requirements of § 61.197 were
accomplished. The applicant must present a FIRC graduation certificate to a FSDO
within 3 calendar-months of completion of the FIRC. The renewal action of § 61.197(a)
must be accomplished before the expiration date shown on the applicant’s flight
instructor certificate. If the applicant completes a FIRC more than 3 calendar-months
prior to the expiration month of the current flight instructor certificate, the expiration date
will be 24 calendar-months after the month the FAA Form 8710-1 application is
submitted to the FAA, provided the application is submitted within 3 calendar-months of
completion of the FIRC.


**30.2.2** Determining the Expiration Date. The following examples help explain how to determine

the date from which the 24 calendar-month renewal flight instructor certificate should be
dated.

**Example 1:** The flight instructor completes the FIRC within the
3 calendar-months preceding the expiration date of the current certificate
and files an FAA Form 8710-1 application to renew the certificate within
3 calendar-months of the date of graduation from the FIRC. In this example, the
CFI would get a new certificate with a new expiration date of 24 calendar-months
from the date of expiration of his current certificate, as prescribed in
§ 61.197(b)(2)(ii).

**Example 2:** The flight instructor has a certificate with an expiration date of
August 31, 20xx. The FIRC is completed on January 5, 20xx, 7 calendar-months
before the expiration date of the current certificate. The flight instructor applies
for renewal of the certificate on April 13, 20xx, within 3 calendar-months of the
date of the FIRC graduation. The flight instructor would receive a new certificate
with an expiration date of 24 calendar-months from April 30, 20xx, or in other
words, April 30, 20x2.

**Example 3:** The flight instructor has a certificate with an expiration date of
August 31, 20xx. The flight instructor completes the FIRC on March 7, 20xx,
and applies for renewal of the certificate on June 2, 20xx. This is within
3 calendar-months of the date of the FIRC graduation and within


-----

3 calendar-months of the expiration date of the current certificate. In this case,
the flight instructor would receive a new certificate with an expiration date of
24 calendar-months from the date of application, or in other words, an expiration
date of June 30, 20x2. This is because, even though the application is dated within
3 calendar-months preceding the date of expiration of his or her current
certificate, the FIRC was not completed within the 3 calendar-months preceding
the date of expiration of his or her certificate, as required by § 61.197(b)(2)(ii).

**Note:** If you wish to retain the month of expiration of your flight instructor
certificate, it is recommended that you complete the renewal requirements and
submit your renewal application within the 3 calendar-months prior to the month
of expiration of your certificate.

**30.3** **Acceptable Documentation.** There have been several inquiries asking about the intent of
the phrase, “or other documentation acceptable to the Administrator,” in § [61.3(d)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=006725a290e53e34752a6d644394f72f&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_13&rgn=div8) .
During the flight instructor certification renewal process, when a FIRC graduation
certificate is used for renewal and the applicant’s flight instructor certificate is being
processed for renewal, a copy of the FIRC graduation certificate is considered
“documentation acceptable to the Administrator” until the applicant receives his or her
permanent flight instructor certificate. Another example of other “documentation
acceptable to the Administrator” is a copy of the flight instructor renewal application,
FAA Form 8710-1, that the applicant completed and signed.

**30.4** **Requiring a Practical Test.** Regardless of what has been explained in the paragraphs
above, it should be understood that the FAA has the prerogative to require any applicant
to complete a part or the entire applicable flight instructor practical test. A practical test
may be required if there is reason to believe that it will correct some deficiency in the
applicant’s instructing abilities or it has been determined necessary to introduce new
training procedures or certification requirements.

**31** **EXPIRED FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR CERTIFICATE.** The requirements for holders of
an expired flight instructor certificate to obtain a new certificate are located in § 61.199.
A practical test is required to reinstate an expired flight instructor certificate. A DPE or
an ASI will not reinstate expired flight instructor certificates unless the applicant passes a
practical test or the applicant meets the requirements of SFAR 100-2 or § 61.199(a)(3).

1. The holder of an expired flight instructor certificate (i.e., a flight instructor
certificate that conforms to § [61.5(c)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=006725a290e53e34752a6d644394f72f&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_15&rgn=div8) ) may exchange that certificate for a new
certificate (except for a flight instructor certificate with a sport pilot rating) by
passing one practical test, per § 61.183(h), for one of the aircraft ratings held
on that person’s expired flight instructor certificate or by passing a flight
instructor practical test for an additional rating. If the practical test is for a
flight instructor certificate with a sport pilot rating, the examiner may only
issue that rating and provide endorsements for the category and class
privileges tested.


-----

2. Flight instructor ratings or limited flight instructor ratings on a pilot certificate
are no longer valid. To reinstate instructor privileges, the applicant must meet
all requirements for initial issuance of a flight instructor certificate.

3. Relief is available for persons supporting U.S. Armed Forces operations (refer
to SFAR 100-2). FSDOs are authorized to accept an expired flight instructor
certificate to show eligibility under § 61.197 for renewal of a flight instructor
certificate from an eligible person who meets the requirements of
SFAR 100-2. The eligible person must present the FSDO with the required
documents along with FAA Form 8710-1.

4. Military instructors can reinstate an expired flight instructor certificate if, at
the time of application, they can provide a record showing that, within the
preceding 6 calendar-months from the date of application for reinstatement,
the person has passed a U.S. Armed Forces instructor pilot or pilot examiner
proficiency check or completed a U.S. Armed Forces instructor pilot or pilot
examiner training course and received an additional aircraft rating
qualification as a military instructor pilot or pilot examiner that is appropriate
to the flight instructor rating sought (§ 61.199(a)(3)).


**32** **INSTRUMENT RATING.** Section [61.65](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=006725a290e53e34752a6d644394f72f&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_165&rgn=div8) contains specific aeronautical knowledge,

flight proficiency, aeronautical experience, and endorsement requirements for the
instrument rating.

**33** **ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT RATINGS (OTHER THAN ATP).** Specific aeronautical
knowledge, flight proficiency, and endorsement requirements for additional category,
class, or type rating (for ratings other than at the ATP level) are located in § [61.63](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=006725a290e53e34752a6d644394f72f&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_163&rgn=div8) .

**33.1** **Category and Class Ratings.** Applicants adding a category and/or class rating to a
recreational pilot certificate or higher, other than ATP, must have instructor
recommendations and appropriate endorsements. An applicant for other than an ATP
Certificate with airplane category multiengine class rating need not take an additional
knowledge test, provided the person holds an airplane, powered-lift, rotorcraft, PPC,
weight-shift-control aircraft, or airship rating at or above the pilot certificate level sought.
An applicant must pass the required practical test appropriate to the pilot certificate for
the aircraft category and, if applicable, class rating sought. Additionally, applicants must
comply with the requirements of § 61.63, as noted below:


**33.1.1** Category Ratings. Applicants must receive the training and have the aeronautical

experience required by part 61 that applies to the pilot certificate level for the category,
and if applicable, class rating sought.


**33.1.2** Class Ratings. Applicants must be found competent in the knowledge areas and proficient

in the Areas of Operation for the class rating sought.


**33.1.3** Type Ratings. Applicants must have the required training, logbook, or training record

endorsements, and pass the required practical test in accordance with the ATP/type rating
ACS or PTS, as appropriate. Refer to § 61.63(d).


-----

**33.2** **Experimental Category and Class Rating—§** **[61.31(l)(2)(iii)(B)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=006725a290e53e34752a6d644394f72f&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_131&rgn=div8)** **for the Carriage of**

**Passengers.** An applicant holding at least a recreational pilot certificate may apply for the
issuance of a category and class rating limited to a specific make and model of
experimental aircraft in accordance with the provisions of § 61.63(h), with the limitation
“Authorized Experimental Aircraft: [Category] and [Class] rating [Make] and [Model].”
The applicant is required to receive a logbook endorsement from an authorized flight
instructor who has determined that the applicant is proficient to act as PIC of the same
category, class, and make and model of experimental aircraft for which the application
was made. The 5 hours of flight experience must have been logged between
September 1, 2004, and August 31, 2005. Once the pilot complies with the provisions of
§ 61.63(h), that pilot may be issued the appropriate category and class rating limited to a
specific make and model of experimental aircraft.

**33.3** **Tailwheel Endorsement.** Section 61.31(i) prescribes additional training required for
operating tailwheel airplanes. Some tailwheel airplanes have different configurations
such as wheels, floats, or skis. If a pilot is going to act as PIC of an aircraft configured
(equipped) with main wheels and a tailwheel, the pilot must have the training and
endorsement. If the aircraft has skis or floats in place of the wheeled landing gear, the
training cannot be accomplished and thus the endorsement is not required. The training
and endorsement required by the regulation must be done when the aircraft has a
tailwheel in the wheeled landing gear configuration. Refer to § 61.31(i)(2) for an
exception to the training and endorsement requirement.

**34** **ADDITIONAL CATEGORY/CLASS RATINGS AT THE ATP CERTIFICATION**
**LEVEL.**

**34.1** Specific requirements for additional category, class, or type rating (at the ATP
certification level) are located in § [61.165](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=006725a290e53e34752a6d644394f72f&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_1165&rgn=div8) .

**34.2** An instructor recommendation is not required, unless the applicant has failed the practical
test and this is a retest (per § 61.49). Applicants for retest must comply with the
appropriate retest requirements of § 61.49. In addition, the instructor must sign the
applicant’s FAA Form 8710-1 application for the retest. If seeking to add airplane
category and multiengine class rating to an ATP Certificate, the applicant must complete
an approved ATP CTP in accordance with § 61.156 prior to taking the required
knowledge test.

**34.3** An applicant holding an ATP Certificate may apply for the issuance of an appropriate
type rating if one has been established, and experimental aircraft authorization, by make
and model, on the applicant’s pilot certificate, or a temporary letter of authorization
(LOA) issued by the Flight Standards Operations inspector, as appropriate. The applicant
may complete the appropriate aircraft type rating practical test in the subject aircraft. An
applicant may also qualify for an additional aircraft category and class rating on his or
her pilot certificate for an aircraft issued an experimental certificate in accordance with
the provisions of § 61.165(g). If the applicant is unable to meet the requirements of
§ 61.165(g), the applicant may apply in accordance with § 61.165(a)–(f), as applicable.


-----

**35** **OTHER INSTRUCTOR ENDORSEMENTS.** Specific requirements for knowledge,
aeronautical experience, and, as appropriate, testing for the complex airplane, high
performance airplane, tailwheel airplane, pressurized aircraft capable of operating at high
altitudes, and type specific training are found in § 61.31.

**36** **GROUND INSTRUCTOR CERTIFICATION.** The applicability, eligibility,
privileges, and recency requirements for the ground instructor certificate are located in
part 61 subpart [I](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=006725a290e53e34752a6d644394f72f&mc=true&node=sp14.2.61.i&rgn=div6) .

**37** **AUTHORIZED INSTRUCTORS.** Section [61.1](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=006725a290e53e34752a6d644394f72f&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_11&rgn=div8) defines an “authorized instructor” as:

1. A person who holds a ground instructor certificate issued under part 61 and is
in compliance with § [61.217](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=006725a290e53e34752a6d644394f72f&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_1217&rgn=div8) when conducting ground training in accordance
with the privileges and limitations of his or her ground instructor certificate;

2. A person who holds a flight instructor certificate issued under part 61 and is in
compliance with § 61.197 when conducting ground training or flight training
in accordance with the privileges and limitations of his or her flight instructor
certificate; or

3. A person authorized by the Administrator to provide ground training or flight
training under part 61, 121, 135, or [142](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5c5dfbeb62dbbde618a525c5ad81882e&mc=true&node=pt14.3.142&rgn=div5) when conducting ground training or
flight training in accordance with that authority.

**38** **ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR GLIDERS.** Specific training and authorization
requirements for ground-tow, aerotow, and self-launch procedures for gliders are located
in § 61.31(j).

**38.1** **Ground-Tow Procedures.** Pilots who desire to act as PIC of a glider using ground-tow
procedures must have satisfactorily accomplished ground and flight training on
ground-tow procedures and operations. The pilot must have received an endorsement
from an authorized instructor who certifies in that pilot’s logbook that the pilot has been
found proficient in ground-tow procedures and operations. Refer to § 61.31(j)(1)(i).

**38.2** **Aerotow Procedures.** Pilots who desire to act as PIC of a glider using aerotow
procedures must have satisfactorily accomplished ground and flight training on aerotow
procedures and operations. The pilot must have received an endorsement from an
authorized instructor who certifies in that pilot’s logbook that the pilot has been found
proficient in aerotow procedures and operations. Refer to § 61.31(j)(1)(ii).

**38.3** **Self-Launch Procedures.** Pilots who desire to act as PIC of a glider using self-launch
procedures must have satisfactorily accomplished ground and flight training on
self-launch procedures and operations. The pilot must have received an endorsement
from an authorized instructor who certifies in that pilot’s logbook that the pilot has been
found proficient in self-launch procedures and operations. Refer to § 61.31(j)(1)(iii).

**38.4** **Glider Ratings Issued Prior to August 4, 1997.** In accordance with § 61.31(j)(2), the
holder of a glider rating issued prior to August 4, 1997, is considered to be in compliance


-----

with the training and logbook endorsement requirements of § 61.31(j) for the specific
operating privilege for which the holder is already qualified.

**38.5** **Weight-Shift-Control Aircraft Certification Prior to September 1, 2004.** Prior to
September 1, 2004, some weight-shift-control aircraft had been issued an experimental
certificate in the glider category. In these cases only, initial pilot certification for the
issuance of at least a private pilot certificate with a glider rating limited to
weight-shift-control or glider-trike privileges was authorized. After September 1, 2004,
issuance of at least a private pilot certificate with a glider rating limited to
weight-shift-control or glider-trike privileges is no longer authorized, nor necessary, now
that there are established training and certification requirements for weight-shift-control
category aircraft under part 61.

**38.6** **Weight-Shift-Control Aircraft Certification after January 15, 2005.** Effective
January 15, 2005, airmen who conducted their initial pilot certification in a
weight-shift-control aircraft that was certificated as an experimental aircraft in the glider
category and received a private pilot certificate or higher with a glider rating limited to
weight-shift-control or glider-trike privileges can apply using FAA Form 8710-11 at a
FSDO for a weight-shift-control category and/or class rating to be added to their airman
certificate with no further showing of competency.

**39** **ENHANCED FLIGHT VISION SYSTEM (EFVS).** There are two types of EFVS
operations: EFVS operations to 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation (TDZE)
and EFVS operations to touchdown and rollout. An EFVS is an installed aircraft system
which uses an electronic means to provide a display of the forward external scene
topography (the natural or manmade features of a place or region, especially in a way to
show their relative positions and elevation) through the use of imaging sensors, including
but not limited to forward-looking infrared, millimeter wave radiometry, millimeter wave
radar, or low-light level image intensification. An EFVS includes the display element,
sensors, computers and power supplies, indications, and controls. EFVS operations to
100 feet above the TDZE were enabled through [69 FR 1619](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2004/01/09/04-427/enhanced-flight-vision-systems) , Enhanced Flight Vision
Systems, published in 2004. In 2016, the FAA amended the EFVS regulations to also
permit EFVS operations to touchdown and rollout. Additionally, [81 FR 90126](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/13/2016-28714/revisions-to-operational-requirements-for-the-use-of-enhanced-flight-vision-systems-efvs-and-to) , Revisions
to Operational Requirements for the Use of Enhanced Flight Vision Systems (EFVS) and
to Pilot Compartment View Requirements for Vision Systems, published in 2016,
established minimum ground and flight training requirements for pilots conducting EFVS
operations. The operating requirements for EFVS operations can be found in 14 CFR
part [91](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b9858fdff7a48dd36335987dd24e40e1&mc=true&node=pt14.2.91&rgn=div5) , § [91.176](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b9858fdff7a48dd36335987dd24e40e1&mc=true&node=se14.2.91_1176&rgn=div8) , and the minimum ground and flight training requirements for EFVS
operations can be found in § [61.66](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b9858fdff7a48dd36335987dd24e40e1&mc=true&node=se14.2.61_166&rgn=div8) . Operational and training guidance for EFVS
operations can be found in AC [90-106](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentID/1031042) , Enhanced Flight Vision Systems. Recommended
